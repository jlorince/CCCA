[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
AS WE LEARNED IN THE LASTSEGMENT, NO ONE WHO COMMITS
THESE FRAUDULENT FINANCIAL DEALSAND CORPORATION THINGS GOES TO
JAIL WHEN THEY DO SOMETHINGILLEGAL.
DID YOU KNOW THAT THEYALSO DO NOT GO TO
JAIL FOR DOING THINGS THATSHOULD BE ILLEGAL BUT FOR SOME
REASON ARE NOT AT ALL ILLEGAL.
IT'S TRUE.
CASE IN POINT.
A FEW WEEKS AGO BLOOMBERG NEWSBROKE AN UNBELIEVABLE STORY.
IT'S A TALE OF TWO COMPANIESFIRST BLACKSTONE THAT SOUNDS
LIKE IT SHOULD BE AN EVILWIZARDS CASTLE BUT ACTUALLY A
PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM.
SO SAME DEAL.
THE SECOND COMPANY CODERE THATRUNS BETTING PARLORS AND
RACE TRACKS ALL OVER EUROPE.
CLASSY.
EARLY THIS YEAR BLACKSTONEBOUGHT SOMETHING CALLED A CREDIT
DEFAULT SWAP ON DEBT THAT CODEREOWED TO A THIRD PARTY WHICH
MEANS BLACKSTONE WOULD MAKEMONEY IF CODERE BLEW A LOAN
PAYMENT TO THE OTHER GUYS.
THEN A SHORT TIME LATERBLACKSTONE OFFERED CODERE A $100
MILLION WITH THE CONDITION THATTHEY PAY THE OTHER LOAN TO THE
OTHER COMPANY LATE.
THE LOAN BLACKSTONE HAD ALREADYBET THEY WOULD PAY LATE.
BLACKSTONE BACKS THEM AND THEYPAY LATE.
THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP ISTRIGGERED
AND BLACKSTONE COLLECTS $15MILLION IN INSURANCE MONEY.
I'M SURE YOU ARE ASKING YOURSELFHEY I THINK I SAW
THAT IN GOODFELLAS WHEN THEY GETINSURANCE ON A RESTAURANT AND
DELIBERATELY BLOW THE RESTAURANTUP.
IN GOODFELLAS IT'S ILLEGAL.
IN THE FINANCIAL WORLD IT'SABOVE BOARD.
FOR MORE WE TURN TO SENIORCORRESPONDENT SAMANTHA BEE.
SAM, THIS IS INSANE.
SO WHEN A DEAL LIKE THIS GOESDOWN.
HOW MUCH COVERAGE HAS THISINCREDIBLY EGREGIOUS
BEHAVIOR GOTTEN ON THE24 HOUR NEWS NETWORKS?

>> WAIT THERE WAS UM, NOTHING.
>> Jon: REALLY?
600 TELEVISION CHANNELS THREE 24HOUR NEWS NETWORKS.
>> AND NO STORIES BUT IT'S(bleep) CRAZY.
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET AWAYWITH IT.
WHAT BLACKSTONE DID WAS CLEARLYA HUGE STORY BUT THE BUSINESS
NETWORKS EAGER YOUNG REPORTERSHAVE BETTER THINGS TO EXPLAIN.
I WENT TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES"THE PAPER OF RECORD TO FIND OUT
WHY ALL THOSE TV (bleep)WOULDN'T COVER IT.
THIS IS A COMPLEX STORY AND ITTAKES A LOT TO UNPACK IT.
TATHERE'S SORT OF A RULE THATIF YOU
CAN'T DESCRIBE IT IN TEN SECONDSIT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY WANT TO
COVER.
>> I TAKE IT AS A CHALLENGEAND --
>> CAN I JUST LAY OUT THE FACTS.
>> TEN SECONDS. GO.
>> BLACKSTONE LOANED MONEY TO ASPANISH GAMBLING PARLOR COMPANY.
THEY BOUGHT INSURANCE.
>> TIME IS UP.
THAT WAS TERRIBLE LET ME TRY.
RICH (bleep) WANT ALL THEMONEY FOR THEMSELVES.
I HAVE SEVEN SECONDS LEFT.
BABA BOOEY.
BABA BOY.
DONE.
LIUCKILY THEY WERE WILLINGTO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON
BLACKSTONE'SMALFEASANCE. THIS IS
A HUGE STORY HOW DOESTHE "NEW YORK TIMES" COVER IT?
>> "NEW YORK TIMES" DIDN'TCOVER IT.
WHY, WHY DIDN'T YOU COVER THESTORY?
>> WE'RE BUSIER THAN ONE ARMEDPAPER HANGERS COVERING THE
MISCREANTS THAT WE IDENTIFY.
THIS IS ANOTHER DAY ON WALLSTREET.
>> A FRONT PAGE STORY WOULD BEHEDGE FUND WITH EVIL SOUNDING
NAME DIDN'T DO ANYTHINGUNDINGTERRIBLE TODAY.
>> I'M DROWNING IN MATERIAL.
>> WOULD YOU COVER IT IF WESNUCK IT INTO A GAY WEDDING
ANNOUNCEMENT.
>> NOT MY DEPARTMENT.
>> I GUESS THEY ARE TOO BUSYRUNNING STORIES ON POOP FACIALS.
IF TV AND PAPERS DIDN'T HAVE THESTONES FOR IT MAYBE THE WEBE THE
WOULD.
SOMEBODY TELL CHRIS BROWN TOPUNCH BLACKSTONE OR I'LL GO TO
THE PROS.
PITCH ME YOUR BEST IDEAS.
I NEED THEM TO BE TWERK ANDMOSTLY I NEED THEM TO BE
AMAZEBALLS. YOU NERD GO.
>> I FEEL LIKE ANY TIME WE GETTHE CHANCE TO USE A CRAZY
NICHOLAS CAGE PHOTO IN A POST.
>> I LOVE THAT ALREADY.
>> WHAT THEY DID WAS LIKE THEPLOT OF SAW.
>> I LIKE IT IT'S DARK.
>> LIKE DISNEY PRINCESSESDISNEY PRINCESSES EXPLAIN THE
BLACKSTONE STORY.
>> FULL OF GREAT IDEAS.
HOW ABOUT THE BLACKSTONE CREDITDEFAULT DEAL IS JUST
LIKE ROSS ANDRACHEL FROM FRIENDS.
>> OH, MY GOD I THOUGHT I WASTALKING TO YOUNG PEOPLE.
WHY NOT DO A POST ABOUT JOANIEAND CACHIE.
THEY WEREN'T GETTING IT.
WHAT I NEEDED WAS A LOCALNEWSMAN, CATASTROPHIC WEATHER
AND THIS STORY WOULD BE EVERYWHERE.
I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME OVER THESTORM.
BLACKSTONE LOANED A $100 MILLIONTO A STRUGGLING SPANISH COMPANY
CODERE.
WHAT MAKES IT INTERESTING ISTHAT THEY WANTED CODERE TO
DEFAULT ON THE LOAN...

OTHER COMPANY CALLED CODERE ANDGOT THEM TO PURPOSELY MISS A
DEBT PAYMENT TRIGGERING A CREDITEVENT SO BLACKSTONE COULD CASH
IN ON A CREDIT DEFAULT LOAN THEYMADE BETTING THEY WOULD DEFAULT.

AND IT WAS TOTALLY LEGAL ANDTHESE ARE THE KIND OF SHADY
DEALS THAT GOT US INTO THERECESSION INTO THE FIRST PLACE.
