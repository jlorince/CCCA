OF COURSE, WHILEst REPUBLICANS
JOUST FOR POSITION, THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
HAS THE PRIVILEGE AND BENEFIT OF
STAYING ABOVE THE FRAY.
MONTHS AWAY FROM HAVING TO GET
HIS HANDS DIRTY WITH SWING STATE
BUS TRAVEL.
>> Reporter: PRESIDENT OBAMA
GOES TO MINNESOTA TODAY,
STARTING A THREE DAY, THREE
STATE BUS TOUR.
>> Jon: OH FOR (BLEEP)'S SAKE.
(LAUGHTER)
SERIOUSLY?
OBAMA'S BACK IN CAMPAIGN MODE
ALREADY?
>> WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS INSIST
THIS IS AN OFFICIAL EVENT, NOT A
CAMPAIGN EVENT.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
INSISTS THIS IS NOT A CAMPAIGN
TRIP.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
NO, IT'S NOT A CAMPAIGN TRIP.
I'M SURE THE PRESIDENT JUST HAD
SOME FREQUENT GREYHOUND MILES HE
HAD TO BURN.
(LAUGHTER)
BY THE END OF AUGUST OR HE LOSES
THEM.
PLUS I HEAR THAT NATURALLY
OCCURRING SWING STATE RED, WHITE
AND BLUE BUNTING FIELDS ARE IN
FULL BLOOM.
(LAUGHTER)
ACTUALLY, THE WHITE HOUSE INSIST
THIS IS TRIP HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS ELECTION.
>> IT'S A CHANCE FOR BARACK
OBAMA TO TALK ABOUT JOBS.
NOT LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE OUT
THERE IN MIDDLE AMERICA
PANDERING.
>> WHY CANNON FALLS?
>> WHY CANNON FALLS?
(APPLAUSE)
WELL, I HAD HEARD THAT CANNON
FALLS HAS SOME OF THE SMARTEST,
BEST LOOKING KIDS AROUND.
AND YOU HAVE CONFIRMED THE RUMOR
ABOUT THE OUTSTANDING CHILDREN
OF CANNON FALLS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Jon: NOT LIKE NEARBY ARLEN'S
CORNERS.
I MEAN, I HEARD THEIR KIDS ARE
UGLY AS A BAG OF WALRUS US
(BLEEP), AM I RIGHT?
(LAUGHTER)
WALRUS (BLEEP).
ANYBODY BEEN TO ARLEN CORNERS?
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, I'D SHOW YOU
THEIR KIDS AND A BAG OF WALRUS
(BLEEP) AND YOU'D NEVER BEEN B
ABLE TO TELL THEM APART.
WHERE ARE WE HEADING NEXT, BOB?
OH, HAAR LEN'S CORNERS?
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S NOT GOING TO
BE GOOD.
ALL RIGHT, FINE, IT'S A CAMPAIGN
TRIP AND MAYBE A CHANCE FOR
BARACK OBAMA TO WORK OUT NEW
MATERIAL ON THE ROAD.
>> PART OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT, HEALTH CARE REFORM, ALSO
KNOWN AS OBAMACARE.
BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME TELL YOU, EVERY NO
PROBLEM WITH FOLKS SAYING OBAMA
CARES.
I DO CARE.
(APPLAUSE)
IF THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO BE
THE FOLKS WHO DON'T CARE, THAT'S
FINE WITH ME.
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE
SAYING.
WHAT THEY'RE... OH!
A LITTLE SWITCHEROO!
OH, REALLY, YOU SAY OBAMACARE
HAS NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS, I
FIND OBAMACARE QUITE
COMPLEMENTARY.
I'M GLAD YOU USED THAT PHRASE.
AND THANK YOU FOR USING THIS
POSTER AT YOUR RALLY.
I'M A BIG FAN OF CHARLIE
CHAPLIN'S.
(LAUGHTER)
I AM RUBBER, YOU ARE GLUE,
WHATEVER YOU SAY BOUNCES OFF ME
AND STICKS TO YOU.
AS A PRESIDENT, THE LAST TIME HE
RAN WITH AUDACITY OF HOPE,
CHANGE WE CAN BELIEVE IN, I'M
NOT SURE IT WILL FLY.
WHAT'S THIS CAMPAIGN'S "YES, WE
CAN"?
>> WE HAVE A POLITICAL CULTURE
THAT DOESN'T SEEM WILLING TO
MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICES TO MOVE
AMERICA FORWARD.
WHAT'S BROKEN IS OUR POLITICS.
SOME IN CONGRESS WOULD RATHER
SEE OPPONENTS LOSE THAN AMERICA
WIN.
GIVEN THE CHALLENGES WE FACE WE
DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY GAMES.
I KNOW YOU'RE FRUSTRATED AND I'M
FRUSTRATED, TOO.
>> Jon: SO I GUESS THIS TIME
AROUND THE MESSAGE IS "I THOUGHT
WE COULD BUT IT TURNS OUT THE
OTHER GUYS ARE ASS
