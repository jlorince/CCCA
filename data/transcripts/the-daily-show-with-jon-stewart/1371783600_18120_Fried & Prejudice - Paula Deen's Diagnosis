SAUCE OFF HER PLATE.
FOR MORE ON THIS WE ARE
JOINED BY JESSICA WILLIAMS.
JESSICA.
>> HI.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> PAULA DEEN CLEARLY HAS
SAID SOME PROFOUNDLY
OFFENSIVE THINGS.
WHAT IS NEXT?
>> JOHN, I THINK WE ALL NEED
TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND CALM
DOWN.
THIS WOMAN HAS A VERY
SERIOUS CONDITION.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, WE
MENTIONED THAT EARLIER.
SHE HAS DIABETES.
>> NO, NO, NO.
I'M TALKING ABOUT HERR
DISEASE.
PAULA CLEARLY SUFFERS FROM
EITHER TYPE 1 OR TYPE II
RACISM.
>> WOW, I DIDN'T REALIZE
THERE WERE TWO DISTINCT
TYPES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
TYPE 1 RACISM IS INHERITED.
IT RUNS IN FAMILIES.
AND THERE IS REASON TO
BELIEVE THAT DEEN'S ANCESTORS
HAD A STRONG STRAIN OF THE
RACISM GENE.
SHE RECENTLY WENT ON A
GENIOLOGY SHOW AND FOUND OUT
ABOUT SOME FAMILY HEIRLOOMS.
>> LET ME SHOW YOU THIS
DOCUMENT HERE, SEE.
>> SLAVE INHABITANTS.
35, THAT'S A LOT.
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
IS A LOT?
ONE, ONE SLAVE IS A LOT OF
SLAVES, PAULA GENE.
JUST ONE, ONE.
(APPLAUSE)
>> THAT'S FAIR.
SO IF HER FAMILY-OWNED
SLAVES THAT'S PRETTY STRONG
EVIDENCE THAT HER RACISM IS
TYPE 1.
>> NO, IT COULD STILL BE
TYPE II.
>> WHAT IS THAT, THAT IS
ADULT ONSET RACISM.
>> EXACTLY.
THAT'S A LIFESTYLE DISEASE
THAT YOU DEVELOP ONLY AFTER
YEARS OF CLOGGING YOUR BRAIN
VEINS WITH PURE SATURATED
DIXIE NOSTALGIA.
>> IS THERE A CURE.
>> NO, BUT DONE WORRY THESE
DAYS RACISM IS RARELY FATAL
DEFEND-- DEPENDING ON WHO
YOU EXPRESS IT IN FRONT OF.
EVEN IF ARE YOU DIAGNOSED
LATE LIKE PAULA YOU CAN
STILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
AND MANAGE YOUR SYMPTOMS.
>> THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT.
>> WELL, TREATMENT OF RACISM
HAS COME A LONG WAY.
TODAY PEOPLE LIKE PAULA CAN
CONTROL THEIR RACISM
CRAVINGS WITH A NIGGERETTE
PATCH.
>> I'M SORRY, I THINK
MAYBE --
>> NO, A NIGGERETTE PATCH.
>> OH BOY.
>> YOU CAN GET THEM
OVER-THE-COUNTER AT ANY
STUCKEYS OR PIGGLY WIGGLYLY.
YOU SEE THE PATCH HELPS TO
SUPPRESS THE WORD TO BLURT
OUT ANYTHING OFFENSIVE BY
REGULATING ACTIVITY IN THE
BRAIN'S RACISM CENTER KNOWNS
AS THE ANYDDALA.
>> YOU ARE SAYING WITH HELP
PAULA DEEN COULD LIVE A FULL
NORMAL LIFE.
>> SURE, AT LEAST UNTIL SHE
CLOAKED ON A SAUSAGE FRITTER
OR VAT OF BUTTER.
>> THANKS, JESS KA.
YOU HAVE SHOWN REMARKABLE
SYMPATHY FOR SOMEONE WHO
SAID SUCH HORRIBLE HURTFUL
THINGS.
>> PLEASE, PAULA DEEN'S
PEOPLE AREN'T HURTING BLACK
PEOPLE AS MUCH AS HER
RECIPES ARE.
>> THAT'S A FAIR POINT,
JESSICA WILLIAMS, EVERYONE.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BAC
