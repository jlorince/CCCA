WHATEVER, WHATEVER.
BUT, OF COURSE, MITT ROMNEY
STILL HAD AN ACE IN THE HOLE.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S
CONFUSED HANDLING OF THE
CONSULATE ATTACK IN LIBYA THAT
KILLED FOUR AMERICANS.
>> IT WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK,
AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR THAT
TO BE TOLD TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
WHETHER THAT WAS SOME MISLEADING
OR INSTEAD WHETHER WE JUST
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, I
THINK YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF,
WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW FIVE DAYS
LATER WHEN THE AMBASSADOR TO THE
UNITED NATIONS WENT ON TV TO SAY
THAT THIS WAS A DEMONSTRATION.
HOW COULD WE HAVE NOT KNOWN?
>> Jon: BOOM!
MR. PRESIDENT, YOU JUST WALKED
INTO A MITT STORM.
>> THE DAY AFTER THE ATTACK,
GOVERNOR, I STOOD IN THE ROSE
GARDEN AND I TOLD THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE AND THE WORLD THAT WE
WERE GOING TO FIND OUT EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED, THAT THIS WAS AN
ACT OF TERROR AND I ALSO SAID
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HUNT DOWN
THOSE WHO COMMITTED THIS CRIME.
>> Jon: FORCEFUL, REMIND
PEOPLE THAT KILLING TERRORISTS
IS KIND OF YOUR THANG.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT STILL DOES NOT FULLY EXPLAIN
THE COLOSSAL CONFUSION FUELED
[BLEEPED] UPS THAT WERE
BENGHAZI.
AS LONG AS ROMNEY DOESN'T WALK
INTO SOME NITPICKY SEMANTIC TRAP
THAT HADN'T EVEN REALLY BEEN
SEND...
>> I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THE
PRESIDENT SAID ON THE DAY AFTER
THE ATTACK HE WENT IN THE ROSE
GARDEN AND SAID THAT THIS WAS AN
ACT OF TERROR.
>> Jon: OH, BOY.
>> YOU SAID IN THE ROSE GARDEN
AFTER THE ATTACK IT WAS AN ACT
OF TERROR.
IT WAS NOT A CORRESPONDENT
UTAHNIOUS DEMONSTRATION, IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
>> PLEASE PROCEED, GOVERNOR.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: THERE'S YOUR FIRST
CLUE.
WHEN YOU FEEL YOU'RE ABOUT TO
SPRING WHAT YOU, GOVERNOR
ROMNEY, THINK IS THE CHECKMATE
MOMENT OF THE DEBATE, AND YOUR
DEBATE OPPONENT SAYS TO YOU,
"PLEASE, PROCEED," HOLD ON.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
ARE YOU TRYING TO OPEN THAT
DOOR?
ALLOW ME TO OPEN IT WIDER.
THE DOOR THAT YOU APPEAR TO WANT
TO WALK THROUGH.
BUT WHEN YOUR OPPONENT DOES,
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A
BREATH AND WONDER IF WILEY
COYOTE AND THE ROAD RUNNER, THAT
DOOR YOUR OPPONENT IS POINTING
TO, IS MERELY PAINT ON A ROCK.
>> PLEASE PROCEED, GOVERNOR
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET
THAT FOR THE RECORD BECAUSE IT
TOOK THE PRESIDENT 14 DAYS
BEFORE HE CALLED THE ATTACK IN
BENGHAZI AN ACT OF TERROR.
>> GET THE TRANSCRIPT.
>> HE DID, IN FACT, SIR.
SO LET ME CALL IT AN ACT OF
TERROR.
>> CAN YOU SAY THAT A LITTLE
LOUDER, CANDY?
>> HE DID CALL IT AN ACT OF
TERROR.
IT DID, AS WELL...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: CAN YOU SAY IT A
LITTLE LOUDER, CANDY.
CAN YOU SAY IT A LITTLE LOUD
CENTER NOW JUST THE LADIES.
CAN THE LADIES SAY IT?
CAN I GET A WOOT-WOOT.
PLEASE, GOVERNOR ROMNEY,
PROCEED.
IT WAS THAT KIND OF NIGHT FOR
ROMNEY.
THE EVIDENCE OF OBAMA'S VICTORY
AND RESURGENCE WAS EVERYWHERE
POST DEBATE, MSNBC NO LONGER
SEEMED SUICIDAL.
CNN, OF COURSE, LOOKED TO BE
SHOOTING A VIRTUAL DICK IN A BOX
VIDEO, AND...
[APPLAUSE]
OF COURSE, FOX NEWS, WELL...
>> AND THE QUESTIONS, THERE WERE
11 OF THEM.
SIX WERE CLEAR PRO-OBAMA.
>> THEY WERE SOFTBALLS.
>> TOPICS WE HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH
ABOUT.
>> THREE EXTRA MINUTES FOR
OBAMA.
>> MODERATORS IN THESE DEBATES
SHOULD BE PART OF THE FURNITURE.
>> DID SHE ASSIST THE PRESIDENT?
>> MID-SENTENCE TO FACT CHECK
HIM.
>> THE THAT'S THE WORST DEBATE
MODERATION.
>> WHAT THE HECK IS THAT ABOUT.
>> Jon: NO, NO, NO, DON'T HELP
THEM.
JUST LET THEM CRY THEMSELVES TO
SLEEP.
[LAUGHTER]
THE ONLY WAY THEY'LL LEARN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
