(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: SO THE PRESIDENT'S
SPEECH...
(APPLAUSE).
... A LAUNDRY LIST OF THINGS
HE'S DONE AND GONNA DO.
HE MENTIONED THE STATE OF THE
UNION IS STRONG AND GETTING
STRONGER.
TO THE REBUTTAL.
>> WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA CLAIMS
THAT THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS
ANYTHING BUT GRAVE HE MUST KNOW
IN HIS HEART THAT THIS IS NOT
TRUE.
>> Jon: WHAT'S WITH MR. CRANKY
PANTS.
I GUESS SOMEBODY DIDN'T KILL BIN
LADEN.
(LAUGHTER)
ACTUALLY, IT'S INDIANA GOVERN
MITCH DANIELS CHANNELING
REAGAN'S FAMED MORNING IN
AMERICA OPTIMISM BUT INSTEAD OF
MORNING IT'S EVENING AND INSTEAD
OF OPTIMISM IT'S DESPAIR.
HERE'S SOME OF THE JUMP OFF THE
CLIFF NOTES.
>> WE'RE ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE
BEHIND GREECE, SPAIN, AND OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES NOW FACING
ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE.
THE PRESIDENT HAS PUT US ON A
COURSE TO MAKE IT RADICALLY
WORSE IN THE YEARS AHEAD.
THE FIRST GENERATION IN MEMORY
TO FACE A FUTURE LESS PROMISING
THAN THEIR PARENTS.
NO NATION, NO ENTITY, CAN THRIVE
OR SURVIVE INTACT WITH DEBT SO
HUGE AS OURS.
WE HAVE A SHORT GRACE PERIOD TO
DEAL WITH OUR DANGERS.
THE TIME IS RUNNING OUT.
IF WE DRIFT PARALYZED OVER A
NIAGRA OF DEBT WE WILL ALL
SUFFER.
THANKS FOR LISTENING.
GOOD NIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: AS LONG AS WE'RE
TOGETHER MR. PUDDLES NOTHING
MATTERS.
EITHER THAT DUDE IS LIVING IN A
HEALTH SCAPE DEVOID OF ALL OPRAH
BEAUTY OR HE'S FROM INDIANA.
BOOM!
BOOM!
(APPLAUSE)
NOW I REALLY AM GOING TO GET MY
ASS KICKED BY PAULA BROADWELL
BECAUSE I JUST PULL MID-BACK
OUT.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT IF MITCH DANIELS DELIVERED
THE WARNING MITT ROMNEY EMBODY
IT HAD TOLL OUR TROUBLES ARE
TAKING.
THE NORMALLY IN CONTROL AND
STAID ROMNEY DISPLAYED THAT
DANCING HAIR COW LICK AND SWEATY
VISAGE OF A HANDSOME SEEMINGLY
NORMAL STEP DAD IN A MOVIE WHO
LOSES HIS TEMPER AND
ACCIDENTALLY BEATS SOMEONE TO
DEATH WITH A GOLF CLUB.
"NO SON OF MINE LOSES THE SOAP
BOX DERBY!"
BLOOD, BLOOD!
(PHONE RINGS)S)
HELL   1234R0E ALL RIGHT, MITT,
I GUESS IT'S GOOD THOUGH, HE'S
FINALLY GOT FIRE IN HIS BELLY.
>> NOW HE'S TALKING ABOUT ALL
THESE NEW IDEAS AND WHAT HE'S
GOING TO DO?
WELL, WHERE WAS HE DURING HIS
FIRST TWO YEARS?
WHY DIDN'T HE GET THESE THINGS
DONE DURING HIS FIRST TWO YEARS?
SERIOUSLY.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, EVEN WHEN
THERE'S A FIRE INSIDE MITT
ROMNEY IT'S STILL JUST A WEIRD
ELECTRICAL FIRE
