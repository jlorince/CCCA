GAY MARRIAGE.
SO GET OVER IT, CHRISTIE.
BUT, HEY, VETOING BILLS IS THE
GOVERNOR'S PREROGATIVE.
IN VIRGINIA, THEIR GOVERNOR BOB
McDONALD IS SIGNING A BILL
COMING OUT OF HIS LEGISLATURE.
I WONDER IF IT'S TO LEGALIZE GAY
MARRIAGE.
>> THE LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE
ANY WOMAN GETTING AN ABORTION TO
FIRST HAVE A TRANSVAGINAL
ULTRASOUND.
>> OH, MAN!
TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND!
THE 15-MEMBER JAZZ FUSION CHORUS
BAND?
THOSE GUYS ARE AWESOME!
I SAW THEM AT THE BEACON IN '94!
THEY WERE AMAZING!
TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND!
♪ TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUND... ♪
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WAIT A MINUTE.
OH, NOT THE BAND, THE OTHER WITH
THE WAND AND THE HOO HOO.
(LAUGHTER)
YES, THAT VIRGINIA LAW IS THE
SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S INSTALLMENT
OF THE PEW FANNY STATE.
(LAUGHTER)
NOW, BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF
ABORTIONS HAVE PERFORMED IN THE
FIRST TRIMESTER, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO GET AN ULTRASOUND IMAGE AS
THE LAW REQUIRES THE LAW STATES
ANY WOMAN SEEKING TO HAVE THE
LEGAL PROCEDURE KNOWN AS AN
ABORTION MUST, WHETHER SHE WANTS
TO OR NOT, FIRST LAY BACK IN A
CHAIR HER SPREAD LEGGED FEET IN
STIRRUPS AND HAVE AN EIGHT TO
TEN INCH WAND PUT INSIDE HER.
EVEN IF THE WOMAN IN QUESTION IS
PREGNANT AS A RESULT OF A RAPE.
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A JOKE HERE.
I JUST THOUGHT I'D TELL YOU.
ON THE PLUS SIDE, THE WOMEN
WOULD NOT BE FORCED TO LOOK AT
THAT IMAGE.
SEE?
SO IT'S ALL GOOD.
DURING THE ENTIRE WAND FORCIBLY
INSERTED IN YOUR MOST PRIVATE
AREA EXPERIENCE YOU STILL HAVE
COMPLETE AND TOTAL CONTROL OVER
WHAT DIRECTION YOUR HEAD IS
TURNED.
SO JUST SET YOUR IPOD TO
SHUFFLE, FLIP THROUGH A COPY OF
"VANITY FAIR" AND IGNORE THE
FACT YOU'RE BEING HANDLED LIKE A
HUMAN POPSICLE.
OKAY.
FEEL LUCKY?
VIRGINIA COULD HAVE FORCED YOU
TO WATCH THE IMAGE LIKE IN THE
DISTOPIAN CLASSIC "CLOCKWORK
ORANGE."
BUT INSTEAD, THEY'RE JUST GOING
TO BE COMING AT YOU WITH A GIANT
PHALLIC OBJECT LIKE IN
"CLOCKWORK ORANGE."
(LAUGHTER)
AT THIS POINT I'M ALMOST AFRAID
TO ASK.
WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD INTRODUCE
A BILL THAT INFRINGES ON WOMAN'S
RIGHT TO SUCH A DEGREE?
>> THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED BY
LYNCHBURG DELEGATE KATHY BYRON.
>> A LADY?
(BOOS).
>> Jon: AND BY THE WAY,
LYNCHBURG?
ENOUGH WITH THE LIN-SANITY,
OKAY?
(LAUGHTER)
DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO HAVE A
"LIN" IN FRONT OF IT.
SAY THE NAME OF THE TOWN,
INCHBURG.
NO TOWN IN 2012 IN THE SOUTH
WOULD BE NAMED AFTER A HEINOUS
ACT AGAINST ITS MOST... WHAT'S
THAT?
(LAUGHTER)
REALLY?
ALL OVER THE SOUTH?
WELL, THAT IS LIN-SENSITIVE.
(LAUGHTER)
LOOK, I GUESS KATHY BYRON
ADVOCATES SUBSTITUTING
GOVERNMENT INTRUSION FOR
PATIENTS' PERSONAL MEDICAL
DECISIONS.
>> STATE EFFORTS TO MANDATE THE
H.P.V. VACCINE TO MINORS HAVE
RAISED A VARIETY OF CONCERNS.
THE SUBSTITUTION OF OUR JUDGMENT
FOR THE JUDGMENT OF PARENTS IS
EXACTLY THE TYPE OF GOVERNMENT
INTRUSION INTO HEALTH CARE THAT
AMERICA REJECTED AT THE POLLS
LAST NOVEMBER.
>> Jon: I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
ALL I HEARD WAS YOU SUPPORT
AMERICANS REJECTING INTRUSIVE
POLES AND...
(LAUGHTER).
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
TELL YOU!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LOOK AT THAT (BLEEP)ING THING.
SERIOUSLY.
I KNOW MOST DOCTORS BRAG ABOUT
THE SIZE OF THESE BUT,
SERIOUSLY.
(LAUGHTER)
AND GOVERNOR BOB McDONALD,
HE'S FOR THE MANDATORY
ULTRASOUNDS.
IS THERE ANYTHING HE CONSIDERS
TOO INTRUSIVE?
>> FULL-BODY PATDOWNS THAT A LOT
OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT GOING
THROUGH THE T.S.A. LINES.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?
>> I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY OVER
THE LINE WITH REGARD TO PEOPLE'S
CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY AND THEIR
CIVIL LIBERTIES.
>> OKAY, OKAY.
(BOOS).
>> Jon: THEY'RE NOT BOOING,
THEY'RE SAYING "BRUCE."
(LAUGHTER)
WE DID EARLIER A SPRINGSTEEN
STRONG.
LET ME EXPLAIN THE CONCERNS
ABOUT PRIVACY AND LIBERTY IN THE
BILL YOU'RE ABOUT TO SIGN.
WOMEN MIGHT CONSIDER THIS BILL A
T.S.A. PATDOWN INSIDE THEIR
VAGINA.
(LAUGHTER)
AND BY THE WAY, IT'S NOT THAT
VIRGINIA LEGISLATORS DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF FORCED
VIOLATION.
THE SPORTERS OF THIS MANDATORY
ULTRASOUND BILL BELIEVE MANY
THINGS RISE TO THAT LEVEL.
FOR INSTANCE, VIRGINIA
REPUBLICAN DELEGATE BOB MARSHALL
BELIEVES THAT THE HEALTH CARE
REFORM BILL PUT FORTH BY OBAMA
IS NOT REGULATION OF VOLUNTARY
COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE, MORE
ADOWN FORCIBLE ECONOMIC RAPE.
SEE IN BOB MARSHALL FEELS LIKE
HAVING TO BUY SOMETHING YOU
DON'T WANT IS LIKE BEING RAPED.
OH, THE CABLE PACKAGE I WANT HAS
TO HAVE THE LIFETIME MOVIE
NETWORK?
NO!
STOP RAPING ME!
(LAUGHTER)
WHEREAS HAVING SOMETHING SHOVED
INSIDE YOUR GENITALS AGAINST
YOUR WILL IS NOT RAPE.
HE THINKS THAT'S NOT RAPED.
IT'S LIKE A REGIONAL SKWEURBG.
LIKE SOME PLACES IN THE COUNTRY
CALLED SODA POP.
I GUESS WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
IS WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE
REPUBLICANS BEING THE PARTY OF
PERSONAL LIBBER ANY DON'T THEY
REMEMBER THIS GUY?
>> THE NINE MOST TERRIFYING
WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
ARE "I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND
I'M HERE TO HELP."
>> Jon: I GOT NINE SCARIER
WORDS FOR YOU.
(AS RONALD REAGAN)
"I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND
