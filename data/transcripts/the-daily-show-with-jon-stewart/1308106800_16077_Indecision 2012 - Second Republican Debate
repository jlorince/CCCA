TWO XANAX AND...
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S GO TO OR ONGOING COVERAGE
OF "INDECISION 2012."
LAST NIGHT REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS GATHERED
ON THE SET OF THE WORLD'S MOST
PATRIOTIC GAME SHOW.
AMERICA'S GOT AMERICA!
TO ENGAGE IN THEIR PARTY'S
SECOND DEBATE.
AND IF YOU THINK THIS DEBATE WAS
GOING TO BE LIKE EVERY OTHER
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE YOU'VE EVER
SEEN, YOU'VE GOT (BLEEP) FOR
BRAINS.
>> TONIGHT'S DEBATE WILL BE
DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE YOU'VE EVER
SEEN.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
EACH CANDIDATE TONIGHT HAS BEEN
POISONED.
(LAUGHTER)
AND HAS BUT THREE HOURS TO LIVE.
OH, THERE'S AN ANECDOTE-- HIDDEN
IN A BOX.
(LAUGHTER)
BEING SAT UPON BY A GAY MARRIED
COUPLE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND DID I MENTION IT'S WRAPPED
IN THE ONLY ORIGINAL COPY OF OUR
NATION'S CONSTITUTION.
TO GET THE ANECDOTE, YOU MUCH
TOUCH THE MARRIED GAYS AND RIP
OUR CONSTITUTION!
QUITE DIABOLICAL.
HA, HA, HA, HA.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT, I GUESS I'LL LET JOHN
KING... I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY
DON'T PUT ME IN MORE MOVIES.
(LAUGHTER)
I'LL LET JOHN KING TELL YOU WHY
THIS DEBATE IS DIFFERENT.
>> IN ADDITION TO QUESTIONS FROM
MYSELF AND JOURNALISTS FROM OUR
PARTNERS, CANDIDATES WILL TAKE
QUESTIONS DIRECTLY FROM VOTEERS
RIGHT HERE IN MANCHESTER AS WELL
AS HAVE FROM VOTERS AT TOWN
MEETINGS TAKING PLACE TONIGHT
ALL ACROSS NEW HAMPSHIRE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: HOW THE (BLEEP) IS THAT
DIFFERENT?
(LAUGHTER)
YOU MEAN LIKE THE DEBATE A
COUPLE YEARS AGO WHERE EVERYONE
HAS QUESTIONS ON YOUTUBE?
COME ON.
ACTUALLY, CNN ASKED FOR AND GOT
SOME PRETTY GOOD QUESTIONS FROM
TWITTER AND FACEBOOK.
>> LOT OF GOOD QUESTIONS.
WOULD YOU HAVE RELEASED THE BIN
LADEN PHOTOS?
WOULD YOU SUPPORT ISSUES... GOOD
QUESTIONS FROM OUR VIEWERS THERE
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
>> WHAT?
NO, DON'T... NOT RIGHT BACK.
NORVIN A. WENT TO TROUBLE COMING
UP WITH A QUESTION AND YOU'RE
NOT GOING ASK IT?
WHAT KNOCKED THAT QUESTION OFF
THE TABLE?
>> ELVIS OR JOHNNY CASH?
"DANCING WITH THE STARS" OR
AMERICAN IDOL.
LENO OR CONAN?
DEEP DISH OR THIN CRUST?
BLACKBERRY OR IPHONE?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I HAVE A FOLLOW UP.
CRAZY BREAD OR CHUR ROS?
(LAUGHTER)
CASH OR CREDIT?
OH, WAIT, I'M SORRY, WE'RE
TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH
CANDIDATES IS BEST QUALIFIED TO
PERHAPS RUN AMERICA.
ARE THERE ANY HASHTAG INNOVATIVE
WWW./DEBATE (BLEEP)ING ANNOYING
TV.TV/BIEBER YOU HAVE UP YOUR
SLEEVE BEFORE WE MOVE ON?
>> YOU'LL SEE AN ELECTRONIC CODE
ON YOUR SCREEN.
YOU CAN SNAP A PICTURE OF THAT
CODE, YOU'LL GET EXCLUSIVE

BEHIND-THE-SCENES VIDEO,
ANALYSIS AND CONTENT.
>> YOU'RE SUGGESTING WHILE I
WATCH THIS DEBATE I GET OUT MY
PHONE AND TAKE A PICTURE OF THE
SCREEN WATCHING A MOBILE DEVICE
INTERNET BROWSE FILLED WITH
ANOTHER SCREEN FILLED WITH
CONTENT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO PUT
ON YOUR 24 HOUR SEVEN DAY A WEEK
