(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A PROGRAM FOR YOUTONIGHT THAT WE WORKED ON
ALMOST ALL DAY.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT CHELSEACLINTON, THE DAUGHTER, OF
COURSE, OF FAMED MUSICIANGEORGE CLINTON OF PARLIAMENT
FUNKADELIC. WIND ME UP.
(LAUGHTER)LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT ON THE
SUBJECT OF THE AMERICANSPIRIT.
WE ARE A CAN-DO PEOPLE.
WITH PIONEERING SPIRIT,INDIVIDUALISTS.
WELL, AT LEAST OUR GREAT,GREAT GRANDPARENTS WERE.
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TOCONTEND WITH ALL THE
DISTRACTIONS WE DO LIKE TVOR MASTURBATION.
DID YOU KNOW STEVE JOBSINVENTED THAT IN 1981?
(LAUGHTER)CALLED IT--
(LAUGHTER)ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
I BELIEVE HE CALLED IT THEWHACKINTOSH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)ANYHOW, WHAT I'M TRYING TO
SAY IS AMERICANS LIKEFREEDOM.
WE DON'T LIKE BEING TOLDWHAT TO DO, WHETHER BY A
KING OR THE GOVERNMENT.
THAT'S WHY THINGS LIKE SEATBELT LAWS OR HAVING TO GET
RID OF SLAVES WAS MET WITHSO MUCH RESISTANCE.
WELL GUESS WHAT, NOW THEY'RECOMING FOR YOUR HEALTH CARE.
OBAMACARE WILL CHANGE YOURHEALTH CARE.
AND YOU NEED TO UNDERSTANDHOW.
SOME BUSINESSES COULD GET HITWITH A 40% ADDITIONAL TAX ON
YOUR HEALTH-CARE PLAN.
PLEASE GET THE OBAMACARESURVIVAL GUIDE TODAY.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THANK YOU,
KEVORKIAN LOOKALIKE WHO I THOUGHT WAS
DEAD.
LISTEN, IT'S CLEAR FROM THISGUY'S TONE THAT OBAMACARE
WILL DESTROY ALL THAT WEONCE HELD DEAR IN THIS
COUNTRY, BY REQUIRING HEALTHINSURANCE FROM EMPLOYERS FOR
THE 15% OF AMERICANS WHODON'T CURRENTLY GET THAT.
IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 50EMPLOYEES, THE ACT REQUIRES
COMPANIES TO GIVE HEALTHCARE TO ALL THEIR FULL-TIME
WORKERS OR PAY A PENALTY.
NO WAY AROUND IT.
OR MAYBE THERE'S TWO WAYSAROUND IT.
>> CHUCK, REPLAY THATAIRTIGHT OBAMACARE
REQUIREMENT THAT I JUSTMENTIONED.
>> THE ACT REQUIRESCOMPANIES TO GIVE HEALTH
CARE TO ALL THEIR FULL-TIMEWORKERS OR PAY A PENALTY.
(LAUGHTER)I DON'T REMEMBER WEARING A
YACHTING CAP WHEN I SAIDTHAT.
ANYWAY, THERE'S AN OUT FOREMPLOYERS.
THEY CAN PAY A PENALTY WHICHAMOUNTS TO $2,000 PER
EMPLOYEE.
NOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOTOF MONEY UNTIL YOU COMPARE IT
TO HOW MUCH IT CURRENTLYCOST EMPLOYERS TO INSURE
THEIR WORKERS WHICH IS IDON'T KNOW, $10,000 PER
EMPLOYEE.
SO IF YOU'RE A CORPORATION YOUCOULD DO THE RIGHT THING,
THE MORAL THING, SPEND ABOUT10,000 TO GIVE YOUR
EMPLOYEES HEALTH INSURANCEOR SAVE ABOUT $8 GRAND AND
TELL YOUR EMPLOYEES TO GO[BLEEP] WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'VE BEEN CHOOSING?
>> WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TOSPEND ANY MONEY AT ALL.
WELL, THAT'S WHERE THE OTHERLOOPHOLE COMES IN, THE LAW
ONLY APPLIES TO FULL-TIMEWORKERS, PEOPLE WHO WORK 30
OR MORE HOURS A WEEK.
AND GUESS WHAT.
>> BASICALLY A LOT OFEMPLOYERS ARE SAYING WE
DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR THESEHEALTH-CARE BENEFITS SO
WE'RE GOING TO MOVEFULL-TIME WORKERS TO
PART-TIME WORKERS.
>> HE HAS WORKED AT A SUBWAYFRANCHISE IN MAINE FOR A
DECADE BUT RECENTLY WAS TOLDHIS HOURS WOULD BE CUT TO 29 A
WEEK.
LAURYN GOODRICH WHO OWNS 21SUBWAY FRANCHISES SAYS IT'S
ALL BECAUSE OF THE NEWHEALTH CARE LAW.
>> SOUNDS LIKE THAT GUY'S ISWORKING ON A NEW
SLOGAN FOR SUBWAY.
EAT [BLEEP]
