>> Jon: OUR GUEST TONIGHT, A RENOWNED CHEF.
HE OWNS 14 RESTAURANT, WRITTEN EIGHT COOKBOOKS, HIS LATEST BOOK IS CALLED "MOLTO GUSTON: EASY
ITALIAN COOKING." PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM MARIO BATALI.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> I BELIEVE THAT IT MAY BE TRADITIONAL IN YOUR FAMILY TO HAVE THE PASTE AS A SECOND COURSE.
SO I BROUGHT THE ANTIPASTO TO FINISH IT OFF.
>> Jon: THIS IS DELIGHTFUL.
IT IS THE MOST AVANT-GARDE SEDER PLATE I'VE EVER SEEN.
>> WHY DO WE EAT THE HAM?
>> Jon: IS THIS FROM THE BOOK?
>> ALL OF IT.
>> Jon: WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?  IT SEEMS EASY TO MAKE.
>> THERE'S PEAS, THERE'S ROASTED PEPPERS WITH CAPERSES.
THERE'S PIZELLI.
>> Jon: SURE.
CAN I INTERRUPT YOU VERY QUICKLY.
I HAD TACOZETTI, BUT I HAD IT WITHOUT BZELLI, AND IN MY MOUSE I WAS THINKING, THAT'S TACOZETTI.
>> THERE IS A DOUBLE ENTENDRE GOING ON IN ITALIAN.
YOU DO NOT WANT TO PUT A PIZILLO IN YOUR MOUTH, AT LEAST ON NATIONAL TV.
>> Jon: REALLY?
>> TAKE IT RIGHT OUT.
>> Jon: I JUST SAID THAT.
WHAT DID I SAY?
SERIOUSLY, WHAT DID I SAY?
THIS SHOW IS IN ITALY NOW, AND PEOPLE IN ITALY...
>> THEY'RE GOING TO WONDER IF YOU'RE WITH THE GUY...
>> Jon: THE RENT BOY.
DID I JUST SHARE I WANTED TO SHARE THIS WITH A RENT BOY?
>> YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO PUT SOMETHING IN YOUR MOUTH?
>> Jon: REALLY?
WHY DID THEY MAKE THAT SO CLOSE TO SOMETHING THIS DELICIOUS.
IS THE THING YOU MENTIONED PEAS OR CHEESE?
>> PEAS.
>> Jon: NOW I SEE HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER.
FOR GOD'S SAKE, MAN, I FEEL EMBARRASSED TO EAT IN FRONT OF YOU.
>> WELL, I'LL TRY SOMETHING.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
OH, GOD.
>> I ALWAYS WONDERED HOW MUCH GRAPA YOU GUYS DRINK.
>> Jon: DO YOU HAVE... WHEN YOU GO... HAS IT TAKEN THE PLEASURE OUT OF EATING FOR YOU
TO BE IN A BUSINESS, 14 RESTAURANTS, YOU COOK ALL THE TIME.
CAN YOU ENJOY A MEAL, OR DO YOU BREAK IT DOWN?
FOR ME AT COMEDY CLUBS, THERE'S A LITTLE PART OF ME THAT SITS IN THE BACK AND JUDGES.
DO YOU HAVE THAT WHEN YOU'RE COOKING?
>> WELL, LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY,
MY FAVORITE THING TO EAT IS ANYTHING ANYONE ELSE MAKES.
>> Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
>> YEAH.
>> SO YOU'RE NOT CRITICAL?
>> AS A YOUNG CHEF WHEN I WAS JUST GETTING MY FEET UNDER MY AND FIGURING OUT MY POINT OF
VIEW, YOU WOULD SPEND MOST OF THE DEAL I'D DO IT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE TO REMOVE YOURSELF FROM TOTALLY CRITICIZING EVERY EXPERIENCE.
>> Jon: THIS IS THE BEST
[BLEEP] I HAVE EVER HAD.
IT'S SO GOOD.
[APPLAUSE]
>> SEE HOW QUICKLY YOU LEARNED ITALIAN?
>> Jon: THAT IS... OH.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S SO GOOD.
DO YOU EVER... DO YOU EVER DISAPPOINT YOURSELF?
CAN YOU COOK A MEAL AND THEN YOU EAT IT AND THINK, OH, WHAT WAS I DOING?
OR IS IT JUST SO SECOND NATURE TO YOU?
>> IT IS SECOND NATURE.
WHAT YOU COOK AT HOME, YOU DON'T MAKE COMPLICATED DISHES.
YOU MAKE THINGS THAT COOK RELATIVELY QUICKLY AND THEY'RE MORE BASED ON PRODUCT THAN TECHNIQUE.
SO YOU BRING IT HOME, SAUTE, PUT SOME SAUCE ON THE SIDE AND IT'S GOOD AND WORKS OUT WELL.
>> YOU HAVE 14 RESTAURANTS, ALL THESE COOKBOOKS.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU GO HOME, DO YOU EVEN HAVE TIME TO COOK?
ARE YOU AT THESE RESTAURANTS?
ARE YOU GORDON RAMSEY?
ARE YOU YELLING AT PEOPLE IN THE KITCHEN?
>> I AM DECIDEDLY NOT GORDON RAMSEY.
ALTHOUGH I RESPECT HIM FOR FINDING HIS VOICE IN WHATEVER WORLD THAT IT HAD TO BE.
>> Jon: WHY CAN'T HE USE HIS INSIDE VOICE, THOUGH?
[LAUGHTER]
WHY MUST HE ALL ALWAYS USE HIS OUTSIDE ANGRY VOICE?
>> YOU HAVE NO COMPLICATED THAT INSIDE VOICE MAY BE YELLING AT HIM FROM INSIDE.
>> Jon: AH.
>> GENERALLY COOKS OR CHEFS THAT YELL AT THEIR COOKS ARE EXPRESSING THEIR OWN
SELF-LOATHING FOR NOT HAVING PREPARED THEIR STAFF TO DO THE JOB THEY KNEW WAS COMING AT THEM.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Jon: HEY, GORDON RAMSEY,
MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU TOOK A LOOK IN A POT OF SAUCE NAMED YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
I USED TO WORK FOR A GREAT CATERING COMPANY IN NEW YORK,
GLORIOUS FOODS, AND I USED TO BE THE GUY IN THE BACK, THE GUY WOULD COME BACK AND SAY, "WE
NEED 1,000 TOMATOES," BUT THEY NEVER LET ME MAKE [BLEEP].
[LAUGHTER]
>> WELL, HOW OF THEN DID YOU DO THE JOB, EVERY MITT NTLY NOW?
IF YOU STAYED THERE FOR A WHOLE WEEK IN A ROW, THEY WOULD LET YOU TAKE THE TOPS OFF THE TOMATOES.
TWO WEEKS LATER THEY LET YOU TAKE THE BOX OF TOMATOES OUT OF THE KITCHEN.
>> Jon: FOR YOU, WHAT'S THE END GAME?
DO YOU MOVE THROUGH DIFFERENT CUISINES.
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ITALIAN.
THEN YOU GO THROUGH INDIA AND LEARN ALL ABOUT THAT?
OR DO YOU STICK TO ONE PARTICULAR...
>> I'M STICKING WITH WHAT I'M GOOD AT, WHICH IS MEDITERRANEAN,
BUT MOSTLY ITALIAN.
I LIKE SPANISH FOOD.
I LIKE SOME OF THE SOUTHERN FRENCH FOOD.
>> Jon: DO YOU EVER THINK TO YOU'RE, THE DOUBLE-DOWN SANDWICH, KFC.
>> THEY GOT A LOT OF PRESS.
IT WAS IMPRESSIVE.
I THOUGHT ABOUT EATING IT.
>> Jon: DID YOU REALLY?
>> FOR ABOUT THAT LONG.
I'M NOT AVERSE TO THE IDEA OF USING PROTEIN AS BREAD.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS SOME GENIUS.
THEY MUST HAVE SHOOK A LOT OF IDEAS AROUND BACK AT THE OLD KFC DEVELOPMENT KITCHEN.
I GOT IT.
WE'LL GET RID OF THE BREAD.
THEY GOT RID OF ALL THE CARB DIETS, BUT COME OUT WITH IT ANYWAY.
>> Jon: THE SAME GUY, WHY DON'T WE PUT THE CHICKEN IN THE BUCKET.
BUNGTDS SELL.
A BUCKET OF CHICKEN, YOU GOT TO LOVE THAT.
'D LIKE TO BUY A WHOPPER AND PUT IT INBETWEEN A DOUBLE DOWN AND SEE IF MY STOMACH EXPLODES.
>> WOULD YOU LEAVE THE BREAD?
>> Jon: I'D LEAVE THE BREAD.
>> WHAT IF YOU DID A DOUBLE WHOPPER NO BREAD INSIDE THE CHICKEN
>> Jon: CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?
>> YES.
>> Jon: THIS IS WHY YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL CHEF AND I'M JUST THE GUY.
I HAVE EATEN AT YOUR RESTAURANT,
NOT ALL 14.
THEY'RE UNBELIEVABLE.
AND YOU TRULY ARE, WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT, A MAESTRO?
WHAT WOULD THEY CALL A GRAND CHEF?
>> A LUCKY GUY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SAVE IT FOR RACHEL RAY'S SHOW.
"MOLTO GUSTO." IT'S ON THE||||
