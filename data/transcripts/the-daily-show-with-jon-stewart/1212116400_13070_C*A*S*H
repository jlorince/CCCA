THAT IS ALL THEY COULD FIND.
AS FOR STILL PRESIDENT BUSH
HE IS CONTINUING TO SPRINT
TO THE FINISH.
HE GAVE WHAT WOULD BE HIS
FINAL ADDRESS TO THE
GRADUATING CLASS OF THE
SERVICE ACADEMY OF THE AIR
FORCE ACADEMY IN COLORADO
SPRINGS.
HOW DID HE HANDLE THE
OCCASION?
OH, GREAT, THAT'S GREAT,
JUST GREAT.
WHEN I SEE THE PRESIDENT DO
THE CHEST BUMP, I CANNOT
HELP BUT THINK THAT IF HE
HADN'T BEEN [BLEEP] THINGS
UP FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS,
AND WAS GOOFING AROUND LIKE
THIS, WOULD WE LOVE HIM?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WOULD WE BE LIKE HE
IS IRREPRESSABLE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WHAT A SCAMP.
OR DOES THE WHOLE DOING THAT
WHILE ROME IS BURNING ASPECT
OF HIS PRESIDENCY SOUR US ON
HIS EXUBERANCE?
BUT HERE'S HOW I EXPLAIN IT.
COME WITH ME ON THE JOURNEY,
COME WITH ME ON THE JOURNEY
IF YOU WILL.
IMAGINE THAT WE HAD NEVER
GONE INTO IRAQ, THAT THIS
PRESIDENT HAD TAKEN
IMMEDIATE AND EFFECTIVE
ACTION ON KATRINA, GAS WAS
LIKE 99 CENTS FOR LOW TEST
AND CHENEY HAD NEVER BEEN
BORN, JUST IMAGINE THAT.
AND THEN LOOK AT THESE
PICTURES.
LOOK, HEY, IT'S PRESIDENT
DOING THE HEISMAN, A LITTLE
RING A DING DING, OH, KISS,
KISS, BLOW, BLOW, AND OF
COURSE THE OLD POWER FLICK.
HEH HEH HEH.
YOU LIKE DOGS?
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE
BITCHES?
HEH.
CALL THE PLUMBER, BECAUSE
THESE PIPES ARE ABOUT TO
BURST!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: BUT OF COURSE, HE
DID [BLEEP] THINGS UP.
SO IT ALL JUST SEEMS
ASSANINE.
BUT AT LEAST THE PRESIDENT
IS OUT THERE SUPPORTING THE
TROOPS.
AND ISN'T THAT WHAT'S IT'S
ALL ABOUT.
>> I WATCHED WITH REGRET AS
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
VOTED TO DENY OUR TROOPS THE
SUPPORT NECESSARY TO CARRY
OUT THEIR NEW MISSION.
>> ANYONE CAN SAY THEY
SUPPORT THE TROOPS.
AND WE SHOULD TAKE THEM AT
THEIR WORD.
>> IF YOU REALLY WANT TO
SUPPORT THE TROOPS, DON'T
CUT THEIR LEGS OUT FROM
UNDER THEM.
>> WE DO EXPECT THOSE TO SAY
THEY ARE GOING TO SUPPORT
THE TROOPS TO SUPPORT THEM.
>> WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH
THE POLICIES OR NOT YOU
SHOULD BE SUPPORTING THE
TROOPS IN THE FIELD.
>> AND I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT
OUR TROOPS IN THE FIELD AND
THOSE ON THEIR WAY.
>> Jon: YES!
WE MUST SUPPORT OUR TROOPS.
BUT NOT NECESSARILY WITH
EQUIPMENT OR STRATEGY OR
AFTER-CARE OR ENDING THEIR
SERVICE WHEN YOU PROMISE, OR
HAVING OUR COUNTRY
CONTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY OTHER
THAN SHOP AND NOT QUESTION
US.
NO.
THERE ARE OTHER BETTER WAYS
TO SUPPORT THE TROOPS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: LIKE YOUR FLAG PINS,
YOUR FLAG PIN HATS, YOUR CAR
MAGNETS.
BY THE WAY, ANYONE WHO HAS
SEEN BUSH'S CABINET KNOWS
THEY TAKE THAT SUPPORT THE
TROOP SENTIMENT VERY
SERIOUSLY.
I BELIEVE THAT IS HIS
CABINET RIGHT THERE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I WONDER IF THEY ARE
PLANNING A STRATEGY FOR A
VICTORY IN IRAQ.
LET'S LISTEN IN ON THE
MEETING ♪ WE'LL PUT A BOOM
IN YOUR EYES ♪
♪ IT'S THE AMERICAN WAY ♪
♪.
>> Jon: NOPE, THAT WAS TOBY
KEITH.
BUT THAT'S COOL TOO.
IT'S ANOTHER KIND OF
SUPPORT.
THERE ACTUALLY IS ANOTHER
WAY TO SUPPORT THE TROOPS.
THERE IS A NEW GI BILL
SPONSORED BY VIRGINIA
SENATOR JIM WEBB.
BASICALLY WITH THIS BILL YOU
SPEND THREE YEARS IN THE
ARMY AND THEY WILL PAY YOUR
TUITION TO THE BEST PUBLIC
COLLEGE YOUR STATE HAS TO
OFFER.
GIVE YOU A STIPEND, HOUSING
STIPEND.
THE OLD GI BILL ONLY
REIMBURSED SOLDIERS FOR THE
AVERAGE INSTATE TUITION
COSTS SO THIS NEW BILL IS
MORE GENEROUS FOR OUR
TROOPS.
WHICH IS A HUGE PROBLEM.
WITH ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT
WE SHOWED EARLIER SAYING
SUPPORT THE TROOPS.
WHY?
>> AT A TIME WHEN THE UNITED
STATES MILITARY IS FIGHTING
IN TWO WARS, ONE STUDY
ESTIMATES THAT SENATOR
WEBB'S BILL WILL REDUCE
RETENTION RATES BY 16%.
>> Jon: A 16% DROP IN
RETENTION RATES THAT IS
TOUGH TO REPLACE.
UNLESS, OF COURSE, THAT SAME
GI BILL WOULD SOMEHOW
INCREASE RECRUITMENT IN A
WAY THAT MIGHT OFFSET THAT
LOSS.
>> WHICH ACCORDING TO THE
SAME STUDY McCAIN WAS
QUOTING, IT DOES.
BY 16% TO BE PRECISE.
AND IT MY MATH IS CORRECT,
IF YOU SUBTRACT 16% AND THEN
ADD 16%, YOU GET --
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: A 32,000% INCREASE.
WAIT.
I SUCK AT MATH.
HERE'S THE DEAL.
WHERE DID POTENTIAL SOLDIERS
GET THE IDEA THAT THE
MILITARY WAS SOME KIND OF
FAST TRACK TO COLLEGE IN THE
FIRST PLACE.
>> I DID ALL MY RESEARCH AND
I CAN GET MONEY FOR COLLEGE.
>> WITHOUT THE AIR GUARD,
COLLEGE WAS NOT AN OPTION.
>> THE GUARD HELP IMMEDIATE
PAY FOR MY COLLEGE AND MY
BOOKS.
>> THE BILLS I GOT FROM THE
UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI
WERE ZERO.
>> Jon: OH, RIGHT.
COME ON!
NOBODY BELIEVES THOSE ADS.
PEOPLE REALLY SIGN UP FOR
THE MARINES BECAUSE THEY
WANT TO FIGHT FIRE MONSTERS?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
>> Jon: HELLO?
>> HEY, JON, IT'S ROB RIGGLE.
>> Jon: ROB RIGGLE, A MARINE
AND OUR OWN MILITARY EXPERT.
YOU'RE HOME RIGHT NOW ON
PATTERNITY LEAVE.
HEY, ROB RIGGLE, HOW ARE YOU
DOING.
>> GREAT, JON, GREAT.
JUST CALLED TO TELL YOU I
ACTUALLY DID JOIN THE
MARINES BECAUSE I THOUGHT I
WAS GOING TO FIGHT A FIRE
MONSTER.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOU REALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE GOING TO FIGHT A
FIRE MONSTER?
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THEY COULD
SINK THAT [BLEEP] WITH
COMPUTERS.
>> Jon: HOW IS THE NEW BABY?
>> HE'S GOOD.
HE'S GOOD.
JUST DOING MY BEST TO
PROTECT HIM FROM THE FIRE
MONSTERS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK I SEE ONE NOW.
SHOOT MOTHER [BLEEP].
>> Jon: THANK YOU, ROB.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ROB RIGGLE, EVERYBODY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: NOW OF COURSE --
SURPRISED I DIDN'T PUT THAT
ON MUTE.
OF CURES THIS BEING THE
CAMPAIGN SEASON SENATOR
McCAIN HAD SOME CHOICE WORDS
FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORT THIS
MORE GENEROUS GI BILL.
>> WELL, JOHN McCAIN
RESPONDED RATHER HEATEDLY IN
THIS STATEMENT.
QUOTE, I WILL NOT ACCEPT
FROM SENATOR OBAMA WHO DID
NOT FEEL IT WAS HIS
RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE OUR
COUNTRY IN UNIFORM ANY
LECTURES ON MY REGARD FOR
THOSE WHO DID.
>> Jon: HE'S ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT.
WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW MILITARY
POLICY TO BE SHAPED BY THOSE
WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN COMBAT.
TO DO THAT WOULD BE
OUTRAGEOUS.
IT WOULD BE A HUGE
DISAPPOINTMENT TO ANYBODY
THAT HAS EVER DUG THEMSELVES
ON THE THINGS.
