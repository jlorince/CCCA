>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
WELCOME BACK.
AS WE'VE JUST SEEN SOME NEWS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE TO FLOOD THE ZONE, THE COMMENTATORS.
WE'RE NO DIFFERENT.
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PUNDITS, A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS.
WE'LL SEE WHICH ONE IS GOING TO GET HURT TONIGHT WE'RE INAUGURATING OUR NEW SEGMENT,
WHO WANTS IT MORE?
WE HAVE WYATT CENAC, JOHN OLIVER, AASIF MANDVI AND JASON JONES.
THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS TAKES ON THIS YEAR'S ELECTION BUT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THERE'S ONLY
ONE CHAIR, BOYS.
[LAUGHTER]
WHO WANTS IT MORE?
>> HEY, NO.
>> NO.
>> I GOT IT.
>> NO, NO!
[YELLING]
>> Jon: I NEED A PUNDIT.
I NEED A PUNDIT.
WYATT HAS THE CHAIR.
WYATT CENAC HAS THE CHAIR.
WYATT HAS THE CHAIR.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
(bleep) (bleep) (bleep).
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NICELY DONE, WYATT.
NICELY DONE.
NICELY DONE.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: YEAH!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> JON, THIS ELECTION WAS NOTHING IF NOT A VINDICATION OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY IDEALISM IN
PARTICULAR THEIR CONCERN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
>> Jon: WAIT, THE ENVIRONMENT?
>> YEAH, THE ENVIRONMENT, JON.
DID YOU KNOW JUST TWO YEARS AGO REPUBLICANS WERE AN ENDANGERED SPECIES?
THEY WERE ABOUT TO VANISH LIKE THE DODO BUT NOW THEY ARE EVERYWHERE LIKE THE DODO AND
IT'S ALL THANKS TO DEMOCRATS CONSERVATION EFFORTS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I DON'T THINK THE DEMOCRATS REPOPULATED THE REPUBLICANS ON PURPOSE, WYATT?
>> HOW ELSE CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT,
JON?
ARE YOU SAYING THEY ARE STUPID?
THEY WERE HAND FEEDING THEM THE MISTAKES, THE INFIGHTING, THE BILLS SO THE REPUBLICANS COULD
FLOURISH AND REPOPULATE THE PLAINS OF CONGRESS.
AND NOW LOOK AT THEM.
OH, HARRY AND NANCY MUST BE SO PROUD.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WELL, ACTUALLY NOW IT'S PROBABLY REVERSE WITH REPUBLICANS TAKING A 56-LEAD
SEAT IN THE HOUSE, PERHAPS THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES NOW?
>> ENDANGERED WHAT?
>> Jon: THE ENDANGERS SPECIES LIKE THE REPUBLICANS WERE?
>> THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS REPEELED.
THOSE REPUBLICANS MOVED FAST.||||
