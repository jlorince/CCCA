>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, WELCOME BACK.
WE'RE TALKING WITH SENATOR RANDPAUL.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEINCONSISTENCIES.
YOU BROUGHT UP A POINT THAT SAYSTHEY'RE AGAINST BIG GOVERNMENT
UNTIL THEY'RE FOR IT.
IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THAT'SEVERYBODY, AND I ALMOST THINK,
THEN, I WOULD BE OKAY WITH THATIF THEY MADE THIS INDIVIDUAL
CASES.
YOU KNOW, THIS RELIGIOUS LIBERTYCASE IS AN INTERESTING ONE,
BECAUSE I REMEMBER BACK RIGHTAFTER 9/11 THEY HAD WHAT WAS
CALLED THE GROUND ZERO MOSQUE.
EVERYBODY WAS AGAINST THAT.
YOU CAN'T BUILD THAT.
MAYBE A QUESTION OF RELIGIOUSLIBERTY.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO A GAYCOUPLE GETTING MARRIED AND
SOMEBODY WANTS TO BUY A CAKEFROM A BAKER, WELL THAT'S
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, EXACT SAMEPEOPLE STANDING UP FOR ONE
OR THE OTHER.
>> I THINK THE INCONSISTENCIESAND LACK OF GENUINENESS ARE WHAT
BOTHER REPUBLICANS --
WHY CONGRESS HAS ABOUT A 10%APPROVAL RATING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLYRIGHT, PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT THINGS
THE SAME WAY NO MATTER WHAT THEISSUE IS AND NOT WITH THEIR
PERSONAL BIAS INTO IT.
>> Jon: OR MAKE AN ARGUMENT,YOU KNOW, THIS RELIGIOUS
LIBERTY ARGUMENT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE WORKED BACKWARDS FROM
WE ARE AGAINST THE COURTSGRANTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT TO MARRIAGE EQUALITY, ANDWE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO
GET OUT OF THAT.
MAYBE WE'LL TRY THE STATESRIGHTS ARGUMENT.
OKAY, THAT DIDN'T WORK.
NOW LET'S TRY RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
>> BUT THERE IS ALSO SOMETHINGWE NEED TO SEPARATE OUT.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, THEY TOLD METHEY WERE GOING TO BUILD A
MOSQUE AT 9/11, I WAS HORRIFIEDAND THOUGHT IT WAS A TERRIBLE
THING, BUT AM NOT FOR A LAW TOPREVENT THEM.
IF YOU WANT TO MARCH DOWN THESTREET AND ARE PART OF THE
K.K.K., I AM HORRIFIED BYTTHAT AND OBJECT TO IT, BUT THERE
ARE CERTAIN-- THE FIRSTAMENDMENT IS ABOUT THE RIGHT TO
BE DESPICABLE.
IT'S EASY TO ACCEPT --
>> Jon: BUT YOU CAN'T HARDLYEQUATE THE MOSQUE WITH THE
K.K.K. OR GAY MARRIAGE WITH THEK.K.K. --
I HEAR THAT ARGUMENT A LOT.
>> THE THING IS I THINK YOU CANPERSONALLY OBJECT TO THINGS THE
LAW WILL ALLOW.
IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO SAYTHAT WE ACCEPT EVERYONE ELSE'S
BELIEFS ON EVERYTHING ELSE.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, I'M ABSOLUTELYFOR THE LAW ALLOWING -- NOT
PREVENTING A MOSQUE TO BE BUILT,HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME, I
I THINK IT'S A REALLY REALLY BADIDEA TO BUILD A MOSQUE AT THE
9/11 SITE.
>> Jon: YOU DO KNOW  THOUGH THATTHERE WAS A MOSQUE THERE
ALREADY?
>> I KNOW.
>> Jon: I'M REALLY FASCINATED BYTHE IDEA OF RELIGIOUS
PERSECUTION IN THIS COUNTRYBECAUSE THE DEPTH OF FEELING
SEEMS REAL.
>> FREEDOM DOESN'T MEAN THAT WEALL HAVE TO AGREE WITH EVERYBODY
ELSE'S -- WHO THEY ARE, WHATTHEY ARE, WHAT THE RELIGION IS.
WE DON'T HAVE TO LIKE EVERYBODY.
>> Jon: NOBODY'S ASKING YOU TOBE HAPPY BAKING IT.
>> THE THING IS, WHERE I WOULDSEPARATE IT IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE
PERSONAL OPINIONS, THEY'REAFRAID -- SOME PEOPLE ARE AFRAID
IN OUR COUNTRY THAT THEIRPERSONAL RELIGIOUS OPINIONS
WILL NO LONGER BE ALLOWED EVENIN THEIR CHURCH. AND THERE ARE
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THISBECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS,
OKAY, YOU GIVE A DEDUCTION TOYOUR CHURCH, SO WHO'S MONEY
IS THAT?
IS THAT NOT THE GOVERNMENT'SMONEY AND THEY CAN REGULATE THE
CHURCH BECAUSE IT'S A DEDUCTION.
PEOPLE ARE ARGUING THIS.
I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCEBETWEEN ACCEPTANCE AND
NEUTRALITY OF THE LAW AND TRYINGTO FORCE YOUR OPINION ON
PEOPLE EVEN IN THEIR CHURCH, OREVEN IN THEIR EXPRESSION.
>> Jon: NOBODY'S FORCING IT ONTHE CHURCH.
YOU KNOW, YOU STAND SOMEWHAT...NOT ALONE IN YOUR PARTY BUT EVEN
THERE WHEN  RELIGION ENTERS INTOTHE QUESTION, IT CLOUDS THE IDEA
THAT -- BECAUSE YOU PORTRAY ITAS, WELL, WE DON'T WANT TO
FORCE PEOPLE TO HAVE TO AGREEWITH YOUR BELIEFS, BUT WE'RE
NOT.
WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO THETHING THAT THEY DO FOR THEIR
BUSINESS.
WHAT IS A CHRIS CHAIN BUSINESS?
AND I DON'T MEAN THATDISRESPECTFULLY.
>> BUT I GUESS THE THING ISLET'S SEE YOU DO HAVE SOMEONE--
AND THIS CASE HAS BEEN RULED ONON SORT OF MAKING T-SHIRTS.
YOU HAVE A CHRISTIAN BUSINESS, ITHINK THIS WAS IN LEXINGTON,
KENTUCKY, IN MY STATE, THEYCHOSE NOT TO MAKE SHIRTS THAT
WERE PRO-CHOICE, THEY CHOSE NOTTO MAKE SHIRTS THAT WERE
DEMOCRAT -- BECAUSE THAT'S NOTCHRISTIAN, OF COURSE --
>> Jon: SURE!
THAT'S SATAN!
SOCIAL SECURITY IS THE DEVIL!
WHOO!
>> NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.
BUT, NO, THEN THEY CHOSE TONOT MAKE T-SHIRTS SUPPORTING GAY
MARRIAGE.
THE THING IS THAT DOES SOUND TOME LIKE A FREEDOM ISSUE WHERE
YOU CAN GO DOWN THE STREET ANDGET SOMEBODY ELSE TO MAKE IT.
AND I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO ISINTOLERANT.
I'M SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES INLETTING PEOPOLE LIVE LIFE THE
WAY THEY WANT TO LIVE IT, BUT IALSO WOULD INCLUDE CHRISTIANS IN
THAT, TOO, WHO HAVE A BELIEFTHAT IS DIFFERENT THAN MANY --
>> Jon: WE HAVE THIS IDEACORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE AND
SHOULD IT BE AS EASY AS I DON'TAGREE WITH THIS AND IT'S BECAUSE
I'M CHRISTIAN, BECAUSE THEN,WELL, I MEAN, SEEMS LIKE GAY
MARRIAGE LOOMS A LOT LARGER INTHE MINDS OF CERTAIN
CONSERVATIVES THAN IT DOES INTHE BIBLE, AND THE ONLY THING I
WOULD SAY IS, DON'T THEY SELLCAKES TO SINNERS ALL THE TIME?
ADULTERERS, PEOPLE THAT USE--WHEN YOU COME IN, DO YOU GO,
I'D LIKE A CAKE.
AND THEY GO, DO YOU USE THE NAMEOF THE LORD IN VAIN?
(APPLAUSE)
HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT OUT? ITFEELS DISINGENUOUS.
>> HERE'S THE THING, JON.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WAYYOU TIED THIS ALL TOGETHER
BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT US FULLCIRCLE.
>> Jon: THANK YOU. THANK YOU.IT'S WHAT I DO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUTWHETHER CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE QUESTIONOF THE PATRIOT ACT BECAUSE WHAT
HAVE BEEN FILIBUSTERING ABOUT IS--
(LAUGHTER)
-- WHETHER OR NOT A WARRANT THATHAS A CORPORATION'S NAME ON IT,
VERIZON, CAN COLLECT ALL THERECORDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE --
WHETHER A CORPORATION'S APERSON.
>> Jon: THAT'S MY POINT.
>> SO WE'RE RIGHT BACK TO THEPATRIOT ACT AND I THINK WE AGREE
NOW.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THIS IS GOING TO KEEP MEAWAKE TONIGHT, ISN'T IT?
I'M GOING TO BE SITTING AROUNDGOING, WAIT A MINUTE!
WELL, GOOD LUCK TO YOU WITH ALLTHIS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: I WISH YOU WELL.
TAKING A STAND, IT'S ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW.
SENATOR RAND PAUL, EVERYBODY!
(APPLAUSE)
