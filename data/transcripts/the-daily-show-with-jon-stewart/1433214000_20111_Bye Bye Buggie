PENIS, PENIS, PENIS!
(LAUGHTER)
FOR A WHILE I WAS JUST TEXTINGEGGPLANT EMOJIS, THREE OF THEM.
(LAUGHTER)
PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME,WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE SHOW?
THE N.S.A.' METADATA COLLECTIONISN'T THE ONLY PATRIOT ACT
PROVISION THAT TURNED INTO APUMPKIN AT THE STROKE OF
MIDNIGHT.
>> THE EXPIRED PROGRAMSINCLUDE THE BULK PHONE DATA
PROGRAM, BUT ALSO WIRETAPS,WHICH CAN KEEP TRACK OF A
SUSPECTS WHO CHANGE PHONES, ANDTHIS LONE WOLF PROVISION, WHICH
CAN KEEP TRACK OF SUSPETCSNOT TIED TO A TERRORISM
INVESTIGATION.
>> Jon: CAN WE STOP CALLINGTHEM LONE WOLVES, PLEASE?
THEY'RE [BLEEP]ED UP, DERANGEDMURDERERS, THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.
LONE WOLF MAKES THEM SOUND COOLLIKE, AL QUAIDA CAN'T HANDLE ME,
MAN!
I'M AN ALPHA DOG!
I DON'T NEED A PACK!
YOU MIGHT SAY EVEN THOUGH THEPATRIOT ACT EXPIRED, IT DOESN'T
REALLY SEEM LIKE THE COUNTRY HASCRUMMELED INTO CHAOTIC
VIOLENCE-BASED TERROROCRACY.
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.
>> TERRORISTS LIKE AL QAEDA ANDISIL WON'T SUDDENLY STOP
PLOTTING AGAINST US AT MIDNIGHTTOMORROW.
>> THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOSTDANGEROUS TIME FOR AMERICA SINCE
SEPTEMBER 11TH.
>> A 9-1-1 IN THE POSSESSIONOF NUCLEAR RADIOACTIVE,
BIOLOGICAL OR CHEMICAL WEAPONS--  IT WOULD BE 3 MILLION
PEOPLE, NOT 3,000.
ISN'T THIS PROGRAM AS CRITICALAS ITS EVER BEEN SINCE ITS
INCEPTION GIVEN THE FACT THATTHE MIDDLE EAST IS LITERALLY
ON FIRE AND WE'RE LOSINGEVERYWHERE?
>> Jon: MY GOD.
THE ONE THING THAT'S BEENKEEPING US ALIVE SICNE 9/11 IS
THE N.S.A. BULK COLLECTION OFMETADATA, AND NOW IT'S GONE AND
WE'RE ALONE AT THE MERCY OFANIMALS AND PSYCHOPATHS!
WE TAPED THIS HOURS AGO!
WHO THE HELL KNOWS IF ANY OF YOUARE STILL OUT THERE!
WHAT SORT OF ANTI-AMERICANBASTARD ORGANIZATION WOULD LET
THIS HAPPEN?
>> THIS IS NOT A DEADLINE THATSNUCK UP ON ANYONE!
THEY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS FORYEARS.
BUT THE SENATE PUSHED OFF THEIRVOTE UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.
>> Jon: LIKE A DOG WEARING ACONE LOOKING AT YOU, LIKE, CAN
YOU BELIEVE THEY'RE MAKING MEWEAR THIS CONE?
AND YOU'RE THINKING, YOU'RE THEONE CHEWING YOUR OWN DICK.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED THISDAYS AGO.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU ALWAYS HAD THE POWER TO ENDIT.
BUT THER'S SOMETHING THATSOMEWHAT TROUBLING TO ME.
>> THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T CITE ASINGLE CATES IN WHICH
ANALYSIS OF THE N.S.A'S METADATA COLLECTION ACTUALLY
STOPPED AN IMMINENT TERRORISTATTACK.
>> Jon: OKAY. NOT EVEN THAT.
IT'S THAT THE GOVERNMENT ISMAKING THE CASE THE
CONTROVERSIAL PROVISION OF THEN.S.A. IS WHAT'S BEEN SO
EFFECTIVE.
BUT WE HAVE BEEN HIT BYTERRORIST ACTS.
LONE WOLF, AND OTHERWISE.
THE FORT HOOD SHOOTING, CARTOONDRAWING CONTEST IN TEXAS, THE
BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING.
AND IN EACH CASE, THOSE WEREINDIVIDUALS OUR GOVERNMENT
HAD BEEN ALERTED ABOUT, DID KNOWABOUT.
SO IF THE PATRIOT ACT IS ACTINGSO POORLY, WHY ARE THESE GUYS
SO ADAMENT WE HAVE TO KEEP IT?
IT'S LIKE "JURRASIC PARK"  STAFFSAYING WE CAN'T DEBATE THE FINE
POINTS OF OUR SECURITY RIGHTNOW, WE'RE DEALING WITH OUR
FOURTH CONSECUTIVE DINOSAURESCAPE.
GIVE THE SYSTEM A CHANCE TOWORK!
IF WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROMTHE PATRIOT ACT AND IT'S THE
ONLY THING KEEP I.S.I.S. FROMTURNING AMERICA'S NATIONAL PARKS
INTO JIHADI SUMMER CAMPS, WHYDIDN'T EXTENDING IT PASS?
>> I THINK RAND PAUL ISSIGNIFICANTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE FACT THEY COULD DON'TANYTHING LAST NIGHT.
>> IT'S CLEAR WHO THE WHITEHOUSE IS ANNOYED WITH THIS
MORNING, SENATOR RAND PAUL.
>> I CALL OUT SENATOR PAUL.
THE SELFISHNESS OF ONEINDIVIDUAL IN THE SENATE.
>> I'VE RUN FOR PRESIDENT TWICEBUT NEVER STOOPED TO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.
>> Jon: HE'D ONLY STOOP TOSOMETHING LIKE THIS...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)(LAUGHTER)
I WAS THINK, AFTER SEVEN YEARS,JOHN McCAIN SHOULD KNOW NOT TO
SET HIMSELF UP FOR A PALIN JOKE!BUT HE DOES IT ALL THE TIME.
I IMAGINE JOHN McCain OUTJOGGING WITH AN OUT OF SHAPE
FRIEND AND SAY YOU'RE THE MOSTUSELESS RUNNINGMATE I'VE EVER
HAD!
WHAT? WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING!
BUT AS I WAS SAYING, RAND PAULMADE IT HIS PERSONAL MISSION TO
STOP THIS EXTENSION.
>> REPUBLICAN SENATOR ANDPRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RAND PAUL
BLOCKED A FINAL SENTATE VOTE.
>> SOME ACCUSED PAUL OF CASHINGIN ON THE CONTROVERSY.
THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HASBEEN URGING SUPPORTERS TO CHIP
IN TO HIS STOP N.S.A. FINDSHOWDOWN MONEY BOMB.
>> Jon: MONEY BOMB? PRETTYBALLSY, RAND.
THAT WORDING PROBABLY SET OFFFIVE N.S.A. ALERTS THERE.
THE ONLY WAY THEY WOULD FLAGGEDTHAT HARDER IS IF YOU CALLED IT
THE STOP N.S.A. SPYING MONEYBOMB PRESSURE COOKER
CHEAP FERTILIZER KIDDIE PORNBIN LADEN FUND.
