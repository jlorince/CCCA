HE'S SINGING AND I CAN'T GET OUT!
BUT HERE'S THE WORST PART.
HERE'S THE WORST PART ABOUT ALL THIS PANDERING FOR BOTH-- THE SPEAKING SPANISH, THE SINGING.
ONCE YOU BECOME PRESIDENT YOU HAVE TO KEEP DOING IT.
EXHIBIT A., WHILE NEWT AND MITT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, BARACK OBAMA WAS CONDUCTING A VIRTUAL
TOWN HALL ON GOOGLE PLUS-- YES,
GOOGLE PLUS.
OR AS ALL GMAIL USERS KNOW IT,
WHAT THE ( BLEEP ) IS THAT THING UP THERE?
IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN TURN THAT OFF?
ACTUALLY, I GIVE THE PRESIDENT CREDIT FOR DOING A WEBCAST.
A RISKY MOVE GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ONE OF THOSE WINDOWS WILL POP UP WITH A
SHIRTINGLY JOE BIDEN.
"HEY, WHO'S READY TO PARTY, HUH,
HUH?"  ( LAUGHTER ) DURING THE CHAT, THE PRESIDENT
WAS IN FULL-ON CAMPAIGN MODE WITH A WARM GREETING FOR EVERY QUESTIONER.
>> I'M FROM FORT WORTH TEXAS AND I HAVE TWO BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
>> YOU CAN'T BEAT DAUGHTERS.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN'T-- THAT THEY CAN'T BEAT DAUGHTERS?
THAT SEEMS ODD THAT YOU FEEL COMPELLED-- I HAVE TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS.
"WELL, YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM.
YOU JUST CAN'T." THE CHAT MOSTLY BOILED DOWN TO,
"SO, MR. PRESIDENT, HELP ME." SOMETIMES ON A SURPRISINGLY MICROLEVEL.
>> MY HUSBAND HAS AN ENGINEERING DEGREE WITH OVER 10 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, AND HE WAS LAID OFF
THREE YEARS AGO AND HAS YET TO FIND A PERMANENT JOB IN HIS FIELD.
>> IF YOU SEND ME YOUR HUSBAND'S RESUME, I'D BE INTERESTED IN
FINDING OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT THERE.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  YOU'RE TAKING RESUMES?
DON'T YOU HAVE ( BLEEP ) TO DO.
AREN'T THERE OTHER THINGS TO YOUR PLATE.
MR. PRESIDENT, THE RUSSIANS ARE ABOUT TO LAUNCHIMISMS.
"DID YOU KNOW CARL WAS PROFICIENT IN XCEL.
>> IT SUMMED UP WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT FROM THEIR PRESIDENT, HOW MUCH.
IT WAS WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER THAT.
>> YOU JUST SPOKE OF LAWS.
I I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD STAND UP AND GIVE US A LITTLE JIG REAL QUICK.
>> NO DANCING.
>> Jon:  THE PRESIDENT JUST OFFERED TO FIND YOUR HUSBAND A JOB.
( LAUGHTER ) HE SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU SEND ME
THE RESUME." HE'S SERVING AS THE MONSTER.COM-IN-CHIEF.
(  LAUGHTER  ) AND I BELIEVE YOUR RESPONSE
SHOULD BE, "THAT IS ( BLEEP ) AWESOME, THANK YOU."
NOT, "OH, WHILE WE'RE HERE..." ( BLEEP )
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE ) UNBELIEVABLE.
SINCE YOU WON'T DO IT, I KNOW A GOLDEN-VOICED MORMON WHO WILL.
WE'LL B
