( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH WE'VE GOT ONE PREPARED FORYOU TONIGHT.
TONIGHT, OUR GUEST VERYEXCITING, FROM A SHOW CALLED
"THE GOLDBERGS," ACTOR JEFFGARLIN.
COMEDIAN REALLY, I DON'T WHY ISAID ACTOR.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT FIRST, NOW THAT HILLARYCLINTON
AND SEVERAL REPUBLICANCANDIDATES HAVE THROWN THEIR
HATS INTO THE RING, THE 2016ELECTION SEASON IS FINALLY IN
BLOOM, LIKE A BEAUTIFUL FLOWERTHAT COSTS BILLIONS AND BILLIONS
OF DOLLARS AND ULTIMATELY SMELLSLIKE ( BLEEP ).
( LAUGHTER )THE ELECTION SEASON FLOWER IS
REALLY ONE OF YOURLESS DESIRABLE FLOWERS.
AND EVEN THOUGH THERE IS STILLAN UNGODLY AMOUNT OF TIME UNTIL
THE ELECTION, REPORTERS FOCUSEDON MOSTLY BIG-PICTURE ISSUES.
>> WOULD YOU ATTEND A GAYWEDDING?
>> A SAME-SEX COUPLE THATINVITED YOU TO THEIR WEDDING,
WOULD YOU GO?
>> IF YOU HAD A LOVED ONEOR FRIEND GETTING MARRIED IN A
SAME-SEX WEDDING, WOULD YOUATTEND IT?
>> THE QUESTION IS WOULD YOUATTEND TO A GAY WEDDING?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  IF YOU CAN'T HANDLETHESE QUESTIONS, HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO HANDLE PUTIN ASKING YOUTO GO TO A GAY WEDDING?
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HANDLETHAT?
( LAUGHTER )YEAH.
THIS ELECTION IS GOING TO BOILDOWN TO WHO DO YOU TRUST TO PICK
UP THE PHONE AT 3:00 A.M. ANDR.S.V.P. TO A GAY WEDDING.
( LAUGHTER )BUT THAT IS HOW FAR GAY MARRIAGE
HAS ADVANCED IN THIS COUNTRY.
COMPARE THAT TO THE QUESTIONSG.O.P. CANDIDATES WERE BEING
ASKED IN THE LAST ELECTIONCYCLE.
>> DO YOU BELIEVE STATELAWMAKERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE LEGAL
IN THEIR STATES?
>> WOULD YOU SUPPORT ANAMENDMENT TO THE U.S.
CONSTITUTION DEFINING MARRIAGEAS THE UNION OF ONE MAN AND ONE
WOMAN?
>> WOULD A PRESIDENT SANTORUMPUSH FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT AS PRESIDENT BUSH ONCEPROPOSED BANNING SAME-SEX
MARRIAGE?
>> Jon:  OH, MY GOD!
PRESIDENT SANTORUM.
( LAUGHTER )YOU KILL ME!
YOU GOT ME AGAIN, JOHN KING, YOUPRANGSTER.
( LAUGHTER )OF COURSE, THE NATIONAL SHIFT
MAKES IT A LOT LESS ACCEPTABLENOW FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TO
SAY THE KIND OF THINGS THAT THEYWERE SAYING IN THE LAST CAMPAIGN
CYCLE AS WELL.
>> I AM FOR A CONSTITUTIONALAMENDMENT THAT SAYS THAT
MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN ANDA WOMAN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.
>> THE SACRAMENT OF MARRIAGE ISBASED ON A MAN AND WOMAN.
>> MARRIAGE EXISTED BEFOREGOVERNMENTS EXISTED.
THIS IS A NAPKIN!
I CAN CALL THIS NAPKIN A PAPERTOWEL, BUT IT IS A NAPKIN.
( LAUGHTER )>> Jon:  OH, OH, AND LET ME
GUESS, IN YOUR SCENARIO, THEPAPER TOWEL IS THE GAY GUY.
OH, OKAY.
HOW STEREOTYPICAL YOU CAN GET?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )ALSO, BRAWNY --
ALSO, YOUR ANALOGY IS STUPID.I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD GET THAT
IN THERE. BUT YOU GET MY POINT.
REPUBLICANS CAN NO LONGERDISMISS GAY MARRIAGE OUT OF
HAND.
THEY MUST ENGAGE THE QUESTION.
>> THE QUESTION IS, IF YOU WOULDATTEND TO A GAY WEDDING.
>> YEAH, IF IT'S SOMEBODY IN MYLIFE THAT I LOVED AND CARED FOR,
OF COURSE, I WOULD.
I MEAN, THAT'S, I'M NOT GOING TOHURT THEM SIMPLY BECAUSE I HAVE
-- I DISAGREE WITH A CHOICETHEY'VE MADE.
>> Jon: LOOK, I -- IN MY MIND,OBVIOUSLY, WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS
A CRIME AGAINST GOD, BUT COMEON.
THE RECEPTION'S PROBABLY GOINGTO BE AWESOME.
( LAUGHTER )I MEAN --
AND I DIDN'T LEARN THE ENTIREVOGUE DANCE FOR NOTHING.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )HERE'S HOW FAR-- HERE'S HOW FAR
THIS ISSUE HAS MOVED.
SOME OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVELYCREDENTIALED OF THE CANDIDATES
ARE AT LEAST GOING TO THERECEPTION.
>> A FAMILY MEMBER, TONETTE ANDI ALREADY HAD A FAMILY MEMBER
WHO HAD A RECEPTION, IHAVEN'T BEEN AT A WEDDING,
BUT FOR SOMEONE I LOVE, WEHAVE BEEN AT THE RECEPTION.
>> I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS GAYWHO ASKED ME IF I WOULD GO TO
HIS WEDDING.
AND I WENT HOME AND SAID TO MYWIFE, YOU KNOW,
"MY FRIEND'SGETTING MARRIED.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?DO YOU WANT TO GO?"
SHE GOES,"OH, I'M ABSOLUTELYGOING."
I CALLED HIM TODAY AND SAID,"HEY, JUST LET ME KNOW WHAT TIME
IT IS."
>> Jon:  AND THEN HE SAID 3:00P.M. ON A FRIDAY AND IT'S A
CASH BAR.
AND THEN I SAID, "ARE YOU( BLEEP ) KIDDING ME?
THIS WEDDING IS AN ABOMINATIONONTO THE LORD."
OF COURSE, SOME REPUBLICANSSTILL HAVING TROUBLE SHEDDING
THEIR 2012 WAYS.
>> WOULD YOU, RICK SANTORUM,ATTEND A SAME-SEX WEDDING OF OF
A LOVED ONE OR FAMILY FRIEND ORANYONE YOU WERE CLOSE TO?
>> NO, I WOULD NOT.
I WOULD LOVE THEM AND SUPPORTTHEM.
I WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN THATCEREMONY.
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW, I KNOW--I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO
REDEFINE THE WORD "MARRIAGE" BUTIT DOES APPEAR YOU WANT TO
REDEFINE THE WORDS "LOVE ANDSUPPORT."
BUT NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )IF SANTORUM DOESN'T WANT TO
ATTEND A WEDDING.
THAT'S FINE.
HE'LL BE THERE ON THE WEDDINGNIGHT.
DON'T GOOGLE THAT.
DON'T-- DON'T GOOGLE THAT.
DON'T--( APPLAUSE )
YEAH... YOU'RE GOING TO NEED ANAPKIN AND A PAPER TOWEL.
( LAUGHTER )ANYONE ELSE WANT TO WEIGH IN?
HOW ABOUT STRAIGHT-TALKINGFIREBRAND TED CRUZ?
>> IF YOU HAD A LOVED ONE OR AFRIEND GETTING MARRIED IN A
SAME-SEX WEDDING, WOULD YOUATTEND IT?
>> WELL, I WILL TELL YOU IHAVEN'T FACED THAT CIRCUMSTANCE.
>> Jon: YEAH, NICE TRY,REPORTER.
HE DOESN'T HAVE FRIENDS ANDDOESN'T GET INVITED TO THOSE
THINGS, ESPECIALLY WEDDINGS.
TED CRUZ AND THE HAPPIEST DAY OFSOMEONE'S LIFE, THEY DON'T
REALLY GO TOGETHER.
AT THIS POINT, CANDIDATES WHOOPPOSE GAY MARRIAGE CAN'T DO IT
WITH THE FIRE AND BRIM STONENEVER SHALL A MAN LIETH WITH
A MAN RHETORIC.
THE WORST THEY CAN DO IS SOUNDLIKE THE CATTY RELATIVE.
"I'LL GO BUT...
WHAT KIND OF A VIRGO MARRIES ALIBRA? IT'S JUST..."
REALLY THE ONLY THING THATHASN'T CHANGED IN THE LAST FOUR
YEARS IS HOW ANGRY REPUBLICANSGET WHEN YOU ASK THEM ABOUT IT.
>> WHAT IS THE GOTCHA QUESTIONCOMING WAY OUT OF THE PAST.
I STAND VERY STRONG FOR MARRIAGEBETWEEN ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN.
>> YOU KNOW, THAT'S PART OF THEGOTCHA GAME BUT THE MEDIA TRIES
TO TWIST THE QUESTION OFMARRIAGE INTO, IS THEY TRY TO
TWIST IT INTO A BATTLE OFEMOTIONS AND PERSONALITIES.
>> Jon:  EXACTLY, EMOTIONSAND PERSONALITIES HAVE NO PLACE
IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT MARRIAGE.
( LAUGHTER )MARRIAGE IS AN ABSTRACT
PRINCIPLE THAT EXISTS ON ATHEORETICAL PLAIN AND HAS NO
PRACTICAL IMPACT ONACTUALLY PEOPLE AS GOD INTENDED.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
