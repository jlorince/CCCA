YOUR GREAT-GREAT GRANDFATHER WASONCE THE RICHEST MAN IN BOSTON.
>> HOW COME WE'RE SO POOR?
>> WELL, ALL OF THAT MONEY WASPUT INTO A TRUST.
NOBODY COULD TOUCH IT, EXCEPTFOR YOUR GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.
SHE CONTROLS IT ALL AND DECIDESWHEN TO GIVE WHO WHAT.
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.
>> Jon:  PLEASE WELCOME BACKTO THE PROGRAM, MARK RUFFALO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
FIRST OF ALL, LET ME SAY THIS.
>> OKAY.
>> Jon:  THIS MOVIE ISGREAT, AND YOU'RE TERRIFIC IN
IT.
IT IS ABOUT-- LET ME EXPLAINWHAT IT'S ABOUT.
IT'S ABOUT A POLAR BEAR THATGOES ON FOREVER.
>> AND I WANT TO SAY TO YOU THATI DID ACTUALLY SEE "ROSEWATER."
>> Jon:  DID YOU REALLY?
>> AND THE SCENE -->> SO THAT WAS YOU!
>> WHEN THE SCENE WHEN THE COPCARRIES THE BABY THROUGH THE
BURNING BUILDING, AND THEN THEDOG-- THE DOG --
>> YOU'RE ACTUALLY THINKING OF"BEETHOVEN."
THAT WAS "BEETHOVEN."
>> I'M SO SORRY.
>> Jon:  THAT'S FINE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THIS MOVIE, MAYA FORBES, WHO ISATREMENDOUS WRITER.
SHE WROTE ON SANDERS, TERRIFIC.
THIS IS HER FAMILY.
YOU PLAY A BIPOLAR MAN WHO ISRAISING HER.
>> IT'S HER FATHER AND RAISINGHIS TWO MIXED RACE DAUGHTERS ON
HIS OWN IN THE 70s WHILE HE'SIN A FULL-BLOWN BIPOLAR --
>> Jon: EPISODE.
>> EPISODE OR DEPRESSION ORMANIA.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
WHAT'S SO DIFFICULT ABOUT THIS--AND IT IS TO DO THAT CHARACTER--
BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BEHILARITY, AND YOU WANT TO BE
CAREFUL THAT YOU'RE NOT MAKINGFUN OF, BUT SOMETIMES-- I
REMEMBER MY GRANDMOTHER HADALZHEIMER'S.
SOME INCREDIBLY FUNNY STUFFHAPPENED, BUT THAT'S TOUGH--
THAT'S TOUGH TO EXPRESS.
>> YEAH.
YOU DON'T WANT TO LAUGH ABOUTMENTALLY ILL PEOPLE.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
BUT IT'S REAL LIFE.
>> IT IS.
>> Jon:  AND THAT'S HOWPEOPLE GET THROUGH IT.
>> AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OFWHAT MAKES THE MOVIE WORK SO
WELL IS IT DOES BALANCE OUTSCARY MOMENTS WITH THE HUMOR.
>> Jon:  LET ME ASK YOUSOMETHING-- THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT CAME UP EARLIER-- AND IDON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT
THIS.
HULK VERSUS SUPERMAN.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW, THEY ASKED-- I CAN GIVE YOUMY TAKE ON IT.
>> YEAH, I WANT TO HEAR IT.

BOTH JUMPED, WHO'S COMING DOWNFIRST?
>> OKAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  DON'T YOU THINK?
>> IF-- IF THE HIGH JUMP WAS THEDETERMINING FACTOR OF WHO WOULD
WIN IN, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TOMISS YOU.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  LISTEN TO THIS,THOUGH.
MY POINT IS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SETTLE DOWN.
WHEN HULK GETS MAD.
HE SAYS YOU WOULDN'T LIKE MEWHEN I'M MAD.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT WOULD MAKEHIM SO ( BLEEP ) MAD?
>> CAN WE DO THIS AGAIN SOMEOTHER TIME?
>> Jon:  I WOULD LIKE TO DOTHAT VERY MUCH SO.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I WANT TOTALK ABOUT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME ANDTHIS IS SOMETHING I ADMIRE ABOUT
YOU GREATLY.
A LOT OF CELEBRITIES THEY DROPINTO THESE CHARITY EFFORTS OR
THINGS LIKE THAT.
YOU KNOW, THEY DO IT.
THEY DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT IT.
YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT.
YOU ACT, I THINK, AS A HOBBY TOALLOW YOURSELF MONEY OR WHATEVER
TO WORK ON ISSUES YOU CAREABOUT.
YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT THIS GUY ISDOING-- WHAT'S YOUR
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALLED,100%?
>> THERE'S WATER DEFENSE.
>> Jon:  WATER DEFENSE.
>> WHICH WE DEFEND WATER, WHICHIS --
>> CAN I TELL YOU WHO WOULD BEGREAT AT THAT?
THE HULK.
>> HE IS GREEN.
AND THERE'S THE SOLUTIONSPROJECT, WHICH IS, YOU KNOW,
ACCELERATING THE CHANGE TO TAKETHE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD
TO 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY.
>> Jon:  THAT'S WHAT IT IS,100% RENEWABLE ENERGY.
THAT'S YOUR PASSION.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
A LOT OF GUYS WON'T-- SEE, ALOT OF PEOPLE ARE-- ARE AFRAID
OF WHAT THAT MIGHT DO TOTHEIR IMAGE, THEIR CAREER.
I ADMIRE THE FACT THAT GUAT ITNOT TO BE TRITE, 100%.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon:  IT'S IMPRESS AND IHAVE YOU DO GREAT WORK AND
YOU'VE ACTUALLY SEEN RESULTS.
>> YEAH.
IT STARTED BASICALLY OUT OF THEFIGHT AGAINST FRACKING HERE IN
NEW YORK STATE, WHICH WE WON.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND-- PEOPLE NEVER WIN.
WE NEVER WIN, YOU KNOW, BUT WEWON.
WE HAD RUMSFELD RUNNING THINGSINSTEAD SO WE WON.
OUT OF THAT CAME AN IDEA, OKAY,SO IF WE DON'T USE HYDROFRACKING
WHAT DO WE DO?
AND THAT BROUGHT ME TO STANFORDWHERE I MET PROFESSOR JACOBSON,
AND I SAID I SAW YOU DID A PAPERABOUT HYPOTHETICALLY TAKING THE
UNITED STATES TO 100% RENEWABLEENERGY.
COULD YOU DO THAT FOR NEW YORKSTATE?
AND COULD YOU DO THAT IN LET'SSAY 30 YEARS?
AND HE SAID, "I CAN'T HELP YOU.
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF MIDTERMS."
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  WELL, I THOUGHTTHIS STFERS ACTUALLY GOING TO A
DIFFERENT PLACE.
>> TWO DAYS LATER, I GOT 25PAGES OF WHAT BECAME THE
SUSTAINABLE-- THE STUDY TO TAKENEW YORK STATE TO 100% RENEWABLE
ENERGY.
SINCE THEN WE'VE DONE 50 STATESAND 50 PLANS.
