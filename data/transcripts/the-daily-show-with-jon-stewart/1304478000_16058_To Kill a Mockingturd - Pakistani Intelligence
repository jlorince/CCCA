WHICH ONE YOU WERE BETTER AT,
QUITE FRANKLY.
BUT FIRST WE TURN TO OUR
CONTINUING COVERAGE, DAY TWO,
THE DEMISE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN.
I'LL ADMIT, I'LL ADMIT,
YESTERDAY'S SHOW, YESTERDAY'S
SHOW WAS I.D. DRIVEN, AN
MALLISTIC, ALMOST TRIBAL,
CATHARSIS FUELED.
BUT IN THIS SOBER DAWN,
SELF-REFLECTION AND QUESTIONS
BEGIN TO ENTER THE
CONSCIOUSNESS, QUESTIONS LIKE:
>> WON'T THERE ALWAYS BE THAT
LINGERING DOUBT AMONGST
AMERICAN, WELL, WHERE IS THE
BODY?
HOW DO WE KNOW HE'S DEAD?
WHY ISN'T THERE A PICTURE OF IT?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: NO.
THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION, BUT
ALREADY?
COME ON, MAN.
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO AS A
COUNTRY STOP PRETENDING THAT
THERE'S A LEVEL OF EMPIRICAL
PROOF THAT WILL SATISFY THE
CONSPIRACY SEEKERS AMONGST US?
THESE THINGS ARE NEVER ABOUT
EVIDENCE.
WE COULD HAVE A VIDEOTAPE OF THE
TERROR LEADER HIMSELF HOLDING UP
SUNDAY'S "NEW YORK POST" AND HIS
BIRTH CERTIFICATE IN HIS "I AM
BIN LADEN SERIOUSLY" T-SHIRT
SAYING ON CAMERA, "I THINK THIS
DUDE'S ABOUT TO [BLEEPED] ME UP
BIG TIME."
WOULDN'T MATTER.
HERE'S THE VIDEO.
THIS IS BUZZ ALDRIN.
BUZZ ALDRIN WAS ON THE MOON.
WE SAW HIM LAND THERE ON
TELEVISION.
THIS IS THE CRAP HE HAD TO PUT
UP WITH.
>> YOU'RE A COWARD AND A LIAR
AND A THIEF.
>> Jon: APPARENTLY ONLY ONE OF
THOSE MEN REENTERED THE EARTH'S
AT MS FEAR.
-- ATMOSPHERE.
COME ON.
THE NAGGING QUESTION IN MY MIND
CONCERNS PAKISTAN.
THE COUNTRY WHOSE SUBURB OF
ABBOTTABAD HAS BEEN HOME TO BIN
LADEN FOR APPARENTLY THE LAST
SIX YEARS.
AND, YOU KNOW, PAKISTAN WAS LAST
YEAR'S HONORED RECIPIENT OF THE
UNITED STATES' $3.2 BILLION "BE
OUR FRIEND PLEASE" SCHOLARSHIP
AWARDED EACH YEAR TO THE COUNTRY
THAT IF WE DIDN'T GIVE THEM $3.2
BILLION WOULD IN NO WAY BE OUR
FRIEND.
[LAUGHTER]
I WAS REMINDED OF AN INTERVIEW
THAT PAKISTAN'S PRIME MINISTER
DID LAST YEAR.
>> OSAMA BIN LADEN IS NOT IN
PAKISTAN.
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE HE'S
NOT IN PAKISTAN?
>> BECAUSE THERE ARE MILITARY
ACTIONS THAT ARE VERY
SUCCESSFUL.
IF THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ANY
CHANCE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
ARRESTED.
>> Jon: REALLY, WOULD HAVE
BEEN ARRESTED.
[LAUGHTER]
YOUR MILITARY ACTIONS VERY
SUCCESSFUL, WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
HIM.
YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY WAS THERE
CHANCE THAT BIN LADEN HAD BEEN
LIVING IN PAKISTAN FOR SIX
YEARS, HE WAS LIVING HALF A MILE
FROM PAKISTAN'S VERSION OF WEST
POINT IN A TOWN SURROUNDED BY
RETIRED EX-MILITARY OFFICERS.
A HALF MILE.
LOOK AT THAT IN NEW YORK CITY
TERMS.
BIN LADEN WAS ON 21st AND
7th AVENUE.
THEY WERE ON 21st AND 9th
AVENUE.
[LAUGHTER]
IF THE PAKISTANI MILITARY
ACADEMY WERE DOMINO, THEY WOULD
DELIVER TO BIN LADEN ON FOOT.
THE PAKISTANI MILITARY, THE
PAKISTANI MILITARY COULD HAVE
CAUGHT BIN LADEN WITH A ROD AND
REEL.
OR A GIANT ACME MAGNET.
YOU WERE NEIGHBORS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M SORRY.
MAYBE... TO BE FAIR, MAYBE OSAMA
WAS KIND OF IN A STEALTH J.D.
SALINGER MODE.
>> ONLY 35 MILES FROM ISLAMABAD,
BIN LADEN'S COMPOUND BECAUSE
McMAHON SHUN.
>> SURROUNDED BY WALLS TEN TO
18-FEET HIGH TOPPED WITH WASHED
WIRE.
>> NO INTERNET, NO PHONE.
>> EIGHT TIMES THE SIZE OF
NEARBY HOUSES.
>> THEY BURNED THEIR GARBAGE
INSTEAD OF TAKING IT OUT LIKE
THE REST OF THE NEIGHBORS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: COULD IT HAVE BEEN ANY
MORE OBVIOUS?
LOOK AT THE MAN'S MAILBOX, FOR
GOD'S SAKES.
WHAT MORE DID YOU WANT?
WHAT MORE EVIDENCE DID YOU NEED
THAT SOMETHING WAS AWRY IN THAT
ONE CUL-DE-SAC?
WHAT DID YOU NEED, ABJECT
CRUELTY TO SCHOOLCHILDREN?
>> WHEN CHILDREN, LOCAL CHILDREN
PLAYING FOOTBALL NEARBY KICKED
THEIR BALL OVER THE WALL, THE
PEOPLE IN THE COMPOUND JUST GAVE
THEM MONEY AND TOLD THEM TO GO
AND BUY ANOTHER BALL RATHER THAN
LET THEM COME IN AND SEARCH.
>> Jon: HE WOULD KEEP THE
CHILDREN'S BALLS AND THE
MONEY... THE MONEY... THE
MONEY... THE MONEY THAT THEY
GAVE THE CHILDREN WAS IN THE
FORM OF A PERSONAL CHECK FROM
THE DESK OF OSAMA BIN LADEN.
THAT'S... THAT'S WHAT... I DID
NOT KNOW... I DID NOT KNOW YOU
COULD GET THE TWEETY BIRD DEATH
TO AMERICA CHECK.
