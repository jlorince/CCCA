AMERICAN POLITICS, AND IT'S THESUBJECT OF TONIGHT'S

>> QUESTIONS SWIRLING AROUND ADEMOCRATIC PROSPECT FOR
PRESIDENT AND PAYMENTS HISWIFE AND DAUGHTER GOT FROM
HIS POLITICAL ACTIONCOMMITTEE.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT $90,000OVER SOME 12 YEARS BUT IT
WAS PAID TO HIS CLOSERELATIVES.
HIS DAUGHTER DOES HAVE A WEBMARKETING FIRM.
SHE REDID HIS WEBSITE ANDHELPED WITH SOME OF THE WEB
2016 MATERIAL.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: I BELIEVE I HAVE A
CLEVER REPOST TO THAT.
SO YOU ARE SAYING JIM WEBBIS EMBROILED IN A SCANDAL
INVOLVING A WEB SITE.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S THE MOST IRONIC FALL FROM
GRACE SINCE SENATOR MELVINDICKPICTWEET.
(LAUGHTER)WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS
BORN, THAT WASN'T A THING.
AND AS HE GOT OLDER,THEY -- HEY, DICKPICTWEET, AND
HE THOUGHT OH, I SHOULD REALLYSEE WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.
OBVIOUSLY IT HURT HIS CAREERMUCH TO HIS APPARENT
DISDAIN.
SO NOT THAT WE NEED OTHEROPTIONS FOR PRESIDENT, BUT
PLEASE TELL ME WE HAVE OTHEROPTIONS.

HIS TIME OUTSIDE OF NEWJERSEY.

YOU CAN STAY OUT OF THESTATE, CHRISTIE, AS LONG AS
YOU KEEP IT RESPECTFUL.
>> GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE, HEWAS BACK IN THE COWBOY'S
OWNER'S BOX LAST NIGHT.
>> Jon: I ASSUME THE PHRASEBACK IN THE COWBOY'S OWNER
BOXES IS SOME SORT OF SLANGFOR SNORTING CRYSTAL METH
AND HORSE (BLEEP) OUT OF ACOWBOY HAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE
MUCH MORE PREFERABLE THANSITTING NEXT TO JERRY JONES
THE OWNER OF THE DALLAS COWBOYS,THE MOST HATED MAN OF THE
TRI-STATE AREA.
>> HIS FAVORITE FOOTBALLTEAM WAS HOSTING THE DETROIT
LIONS IN THE PLAYOFFS.
AND WHEN THE COWBOYS MADE A LATECOME BACK TO WIN THE GAME, THERE
IS THE GOVERNOR GOING FOR THEHIGH FIVE WITH DALLAS OWNER
JERRY JONES.
>> Jon: MOTHER [BLEEP] YOULEAD A STATE, CHRISTIE, THAT'S
HALF GIANTS FANS, HALF EAGLESFANS AND YOU ARE GROPING THE
OWNER OF THE DALLAS [BLEEP]COWBOYS?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST BREAK ACOPY OF "BORN TO RUN" OVER THE
HEAD OF A HURRICANE SANDYVICTIM YOU BACKSTABBING
PIECE OF [BLEEP].
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NOT ONLY -- NOT ONLY DO WE NOT
WANT TO SEE YOU HUGGINGJERRY JONES.
I DON'T THINK JERRY JONESWANTS TO SEE YOU HUGGING
JERRY JONES.
LOOK AT HIM -- LOOK AT HIM TRYTO GET AWAY.
TRYING TO EVADE THE TACKLE.
