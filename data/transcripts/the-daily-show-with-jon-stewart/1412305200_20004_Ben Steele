>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER.
HIS LATEST IS HBO'S "HUNTED:  THE WAR AGAINST GAYS IN
RUSSIA".
>> WE HAVE SEEN AN ENORMOUS ATTACKS AGAINST GAYS AND
LESBIANS THAT HAVE MULTIPLIEDACROSS RUSSIA. THEY USE THE
PRETEXT OF FIGHTING PEDOPHILIAIN RUSSIA TO ATTACK GAY PEOPLE.
IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO KNOWTHAT THEY SOMETIMES EITHER
PRETEND OR THEY DON'T KNOWGENUINELY THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN PEDOPHILIAAND HOMOSEXUALITY.
AND THEY USE THESE WORDS INTERCHANGEABLY IN THEIR
DIALOGUE WITH THE VICTIM.
>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOME, BEN STEELE. BEN, SIR!
(APPLAUSE)SO I WANT TO GET SOME CONTEXT
FOR THIS BECAUSE
WHAT WE SHOWED, THAT WAS A CLIP OF SOMEONE FROM A HUMAN
RIGHTS GROUP.>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> WHO WAS SPEAKING ABOUTTHIS ANTI-GAY VIOLENCE IN
RUSSIA THAT HAS REALLY SPIKEDOVER -- WHAT, WHAT PERIOD?
>> THE LAST TWO YEARS REALLY.
THERE'S BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASEOF VIOLENCE AGAINST GAY PEOPLE
ACROSS RUSSIA. ANDTHERE ARE VIGILANTE GROUPS
THAT LURE GAYPEOPLE TO MEET UP AND
THEN ASSAULT THEM, ATTACK THEMVIOLENTLY, AND HUMILIATE THEM
AS WELL, SOMETIMES POURINGURINE ON THEM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND OUTING THEM AS WELL BYPOSTING MOVIES THAT THEY THEN
PUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
>> Jon: AND THEY ARE, THEY AREACTIVELY  SOLICITING FOR THEM.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.>> Jon: PRETENDING TO BE
SOMEBODY AND WHEN THEY DRAWTHEM IN THEY ATTACK THEM.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.>> Jon: SO THE FILM HAS
INCREDIBLY NAUSEATING FOOTAGE OF THESE GROUPS.
THEY'VE ALLOWED YOU IN TO FILM THEM.
WE COULD HAVE SHOWN A CLIP OFTHAT, BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO SEE
IT IN FULL CONTEXT, BECAUSEIT'S, IT'S DISGUSTING.
AND THE THING THAT STRUCK ME WAS THAT NOBODY THAT YOU WERE
FILMING WENT TO YOU AFTERWARDS AND WENT, COULD YOU BLUR MY
FACE? BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE,
WHAT WE'VE ALLOWED YOU TO FILMIS HORRIBLE.
>> YEAH WELL, THE VIGILANTEGROUPS, UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY'RE PROUD OF WHAT THEY DO.
THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE CARRYING OUT GOOD ACTS, AND
THEY BELIEVE THEY'RE ACTING IN THE NAME OF THE MAJORITY OF
RUSSIAN PEOPLE, AND THEYBELIEVE THEY HAVE THE TACIT
SUPPORT OF RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES.SO --
>> Jon: THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVEIT, OR THEY HAVE IT?
>> WELL, OF COURSE, LAST YEARTHE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT PASSED
A LOOSELY WORDED ANTI-PROPAGANDALAW WHICH BANNED WHAT THEY CALL
THE PROMOTION OF HOMOSEXUALITY.
AND EXPLICITLY MAKES REFERENCETO YOUNG PEOPLE, TO MINORS, AND
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING THERE IS IT'S LINKING
HOMOSEXUALITY FALSELY,THEY'RE MAKING A CLAIM THAT
SOMEHOW IT'S DANGEROUSFOR CHILDREN.
AND THAT'S WHY THE GROUPS CLAIMAGAIN FALSELY THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY AND PEDOPHILIAIS ONE AND THE SAME THING.
>> Jon: SO IN OTHER WORDS,THEY CAN, AND WHAT THEY DO IS
THEY FILM THESE ATTACKS,THEY UPLOAD THEM, AND THEN
THEY ARE NOT PROSECUTED,BUT THE INDIVIDUAL
IN THE FILM CAN LOSE THEIR JOB, AND HAS NO RECOURSE?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
SO, THE VIGILANTES ARE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE RESPONSE
OF THE AUTHORITIES.AND THEY DON'T, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE HAPPY TO SHOW THEIRFACES.
>> Jon: AND WHEN SOMEONE -- IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OPENLY,
YOU KNOW, SPEAKING OF PROPAGANDA ON RUSSIAN NETWORKS
WHERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING -- YOUKNOW, CAUSE I KNOW THERE'S,
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE INRUSSIA, WE FILMED SOME GAY
GROUPS AND SAID NO, WE'RE GOINGTO STAY HERE, WE'RE GOING TO
CHANGE IT FROM THE INSIDE.DO THEY HAVE ANY ACCESS TO A
PLATFORM TO SAY THATIS A RIDICULOUS LINK.
IT IS NOT THE SAME THING, AND THIS HAS TO STOP?
>> UNFORTUNATELY, NOT.
UNFORTUNATELY, BOTH THE STATE AND THE CHURCH ARE REINFORCING
THE IDEA THAT PEDOPHILIA ANDHOMOSEXUALITY HAVE
SOME KIND OF LINKAGE. AND WEFILMED, YOU'LL SEE THE
DOCUMENTARY, OR YOU HAVESEEN, AN ATTEMPT BY GAY
PEOPLE TO DEMONSTRATE AND TOTAKE  ACTION.
>> Jon: WELL THEY'RE ONLYALLOWED --
IT'S CRAZY -- ONE PERSONCAN DEMONSTRATE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH. WHEN WEFILMED THAT ONE PERSON WAS
ALLOWED TO DEMONSTRATE ATA TIME, AND EVEN THEN HE WASN'T
ALLOWED TO USE THE PHRASEHOMOSEXUALITY OR GAY.
HE JUST SAID LET'S STOP HATECRIMES.
>> Jon: BECAUSE THAT'SPROPOGANDA.
BECAUSE THAT COULD BEPROPOGANDA.
THAT COULD BE PERCEIVEDAS PROPAGANDA.
AND OF COURSE, THE POLICE COMEALONG AND CLOSE DOWN
HIS ATTEMPTS TO DEMONSTRATEEVEN THEN.
>> Jon: AND THIS IS REALLY,THOUGH, YOU KNOW, RUSSIA IS NOT,
YOU KNOW, A BACK WATER COUNTRY.>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: THIS IS A SOPHISTICATED COUNTRY.
THEY HAVE A HUGE GAY COMMUNITY, A VERY ACTIVE GAY
COMMUNITY.
AND IT'S JUST -- SO WHAT DO THEYDO NOW AS THE CULTURE
HAS TURNED SO QUICKLYAND VIOLENTLY?
>> YEAH WELL, IT'S VERYDISTURBING AND DISTRESSING,
BECAUSE, OF COURSE, RUSSIAHAS A HUGE GAY COMMUNITY.
BUT THE MAJORITY OF GAY PEOPLEIN RUSSIA DON'T LIVE --
THEY REMAIN CLOSETED.>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> THEY DON'T LEAD OPENLIVES. IT'S JUST ONE PERCENT ARE
COMPLETELY OPEN ABOUT THEIRSEXUALITY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THE VAST MAJORITY OFPEOPLE ARE JUST TOO AFRAID TO
COME OUT, AND IT'S A REALLYSAD SITUATION.
>> Jon: WHEN YOU APPROACH THESE GROUPS, HOW DO YOU --
ARE THEY OPEN TO THE IDEA THAT YOU WILL FILM IT?
LIKE, DID IT TAKE CONVINCING?
OR DID YOU JUST SAY, HEY, MAN,CAN I FOLLOW YOU WITH A CAMERA
AND WATCH YOU BE HORRIBLE?
>> WELL, IT WAS, IT WAS A LONG NEGOTIATION PROCESS OVER
SEVERAL MONTHS, AND MAKING CONTACTS WITH THE VIGILANTE
GROUPS THEMSELVES TOOK TIME.
I SPEAK RUSSIAN, SO I WAS ABLE TO BUILD --
>> Jon: I MEAN, WE ALL SPEAKRUSSIAN.
THAT'S NOTHING TO THROWIN THERE -- BELIEVE ME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> SO I WAS ABLE TO BUILD MORE OF A DIALOGUE WITH THE PEOPLE
THAT I WAS MEETING ANDTO EXPLAIN ESSENTIALLY I'M
THERE NOT AS TO PASS JUDGMENT.
I'M THERE TO FILM WHAT'S HAPPENING SO THAT I CAN SHOW
IT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD, AND IT'S FOR THE VIEWER TO
JUDGE THE RIGHTS AND THE WRONGS AND THE MERITS OF WHAT
THEY'RE DOING. AND BECAUSETHEY'RE PROUD OF --
>> Jon: AND THEY REALLY THOUGHT,OH YOU'LL GIVE US A FAIR SHOT,
GREAT. THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
>> AND I THINK THE DOCUMENTARY IS FAIR.
I THINK IT DOES SHOW -->> Jon: OH, IT IS OBJECTIVE.
I MEAN, IT IS OBJECTIVE.
>> YEAH. YEAH.
AND OF COURSE, SO THE ACCESSWHICH I HAD WAS ALSO VERY MUCH
ON A DAY BY DAY BASIS.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I'D BEFILMING LATER THAT DAY OR EVEN
IN AN HOUR OR TWO. IWAS JUST LITERALLY TAGGING
ALONG WITH THEM. AND YOU KNOW,EVEN --
>> Jon: AND IN THEIRVIOLENCE YOU SEE IN IT.
THEY WANT TO YOU SHUT ITDOWN. LIKE THEY GO AT YOU.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. SO IN ONE OFTHE SCENES WHEN A YOUNG MAN
UNEXPECTEDLY COMES IN, HE'SBEEN LURED TO
THE FLAT AND THEY THEN START TO ASSAULT HIM.
THEY PUSH ME OUT OF THE ROOM.
I FORCED MY WAY BACK IN, AND THEY ORDERED ME TO PUT THE
CAMERA DOWN, BUT I KEEP ONFILMING FOR TWO REASONS.
ONE, BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLYIMPORTANT TO SHOW WHAT'S
HAPPENING, THROUGH AN UNFILTEREDLENS. SHOW TO THE WORLD.
BUT ALSO BECAUSE I'M REALLYCONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO THAT YOUNG MAN.>> Jon: OH I --
>> AND BY FILMING, I FEEL THAT IAM ACTUALLY ACTING AS A BREAK
ON THE VIOLENCEWHICH COULD OCCUR.
>> Jon: RIGHT. IT'S PHENOMENALACCESS TO SOMETHING YOU
REALLY HAVE A HARD TIMEBELIEVING IS REAL, AND
I TRULY HOPE THEY GETHBO IN RUSSIA.
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY DO.
CHANCES ARE THEY DON'T.
BUT IT'S A REMARKABLEWORK. AND YOU KNOW, AS THEY SAY,
SUNLIGHT IS THE BESTDISINFECTANT.
BUT, "HUNTED: THE WARAGAINST GAYS IN RUSSIA",
IT PREMIERES MONDAY OCTOBER6th ON HBO.
BEN STEELE.
>> THANK YOU.>> Jon: NICE WORK.
