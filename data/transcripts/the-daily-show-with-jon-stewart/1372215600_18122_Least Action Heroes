AND THEY DO THAT WELL.
THEY DO THAT WELL.
NOW-- NOW TO BE FAIR, TO BE
FAIR, THERE IS GOOD NEWS AND
BAD NEWS.
GOOD NEWS, THE COURTS DID
LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN FOR THE
LAW TO BE AMENDED.
BAD NEWS, IT HAS TO BE
AMENDED BY CONGRESS.
SO, SO-- WAIT, WAIT, HAVE
SOME FAITH BOYS AND GIRLS.
SO CAN THEY BE TRUSTED TO
GET THIS DONE?
WELL, LET'S LOOK AT THEIR
RECENT TRACK RECORD.
LAST WEEK THEY TOOK UP THE
FARM BILL, FAMOUSLY ONE OF
THE EASIEST PIECES OF
LEGISLATION THEY HAVE TO
VOTE ON.
AND DON'T WORRY, THEY MADE
HISTORY.
>> IN WASHINGTON THE HOUSE
VOTED DOWN A FARM BILL FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN AT LEAST
40 YEARS.
>> WE DID IT!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WE DID IT!
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
SORT THIS OUT-- THEY VOTED
IT DOWN?
WHY WOULD THEY POKE THE
HEARTLAND RIGHT IN THE CORN
HOLE?
>> 80% OF IT ISN'T REALLY
ABOUT FARMING, PER SE.
THE BULK OF THE FARM BILL IS
THE COUNTRY'S FOOD STAMP
PROGRAM OR WHAT IS NOW KNOWN
AS THE SUPPLEMENTAL
NUTRITION ASSISTANT PROGRAM
OR SNAP.
>> OR SNAP! DID YOU JUST
HEAR WHAT HE JUST CALLED
FOOD STAMPS, HE CALLED THEM
THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITIONAL
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, SNAP!
(LAUGHTER)
SO-- HANG ON, HANG ON.
HANG ON.
FARM BILL IS A FAKE NAME TO
TRICK US INTO FEEDING POOR
PEOPLE.
I THOUGHT THAT THOSE
BILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS
WENT TO A GOOD CAUSE LIKE
PAYING LOCAL FARMERS LIKE
MONSANTO TO NOT GROW CORN IN
THEIR FIELDS, AND INSTEAD
YOU'RE JUST GIVING MONEY TO
HUNGRY PEOPLE FOR FOOD,
WHICH THEY ARE LITERALLY
FLUSHING DOWN THE TOILET
AFTER EATING AND DIGESTING
FOR VITAL NUTRITION.
(LAUGHTER)
I ASSUME THAT THAT IS WHY
THIS BILL FAILED.
>> THE FARM BILL FAILED
BECAUSE VERY CONSERVATIVE
REPUBLICANS VOTED AGAINST IT
BECAUSE THEY SAID IT COSTS
TOO MUCH.
DEMOCRATS VOTED AGAINST IT
BECAUSE IT CUT TOO MUCH FROM
FOOD STAMP.
>> OKAY.
SO NOT ONLY DIDN'T IT CUT
ENOUGH SPENDING, IT ALSO CUT
TOO MUCH SPENDING.
IT'S LIKE THE BILL WAS
GOLDILOCKS AND THE FIRST
BEAR SAYS I THINK YOUR FOOD
STAMP CUTS ARE TOO LOW.
AND THE SECOND BEAR SAYS I
THINK YOUR FOOD STAMP CUTS
ARE TOO HIGH.
AND INSTEAD OF THERE BEING A
MODERATE BEAR THE FIRST TWO
BEARS TEAR GOLDILOCKS LIMB
FROM LIMB AND EAT HER.
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT
HAPPENED.
(APPLAUSE)
TO BE FAIR, THEY ARE BEARS.
IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY ARE
VOTING DOWN BILLS THAT WOULD
DO SOMETHING.
THEY ARE PASSING BILLS THAT
WOULD HAVE NO CHANCE OF EVER
DOING ANYTHING.
>> CONGRESS VOTED ON OBAMA
CARE THIS WEEK.
IT WAS THE 37th TIME THEY
DID IT IN SOME WAY, SHAPE,
FORM OR FASHION.
THE REPUBLICAN LEAD HOUSE
DID VOTE TO REPEAL IT BUT
THE BILL, OF COURSE, IS DEAD
ON ARRIVAL IN THE SENATE.
>> 37 DIFFERENT VOTES AND
NOTHING.
IT'S ALMOST IMPRESSIVE TO
VOTE 37 DIFFERENT TIMES ON
SOMETHING AND STILL GET
NADA.
UNLESS, UNLESS MAYBE THIS
ISN'T INEPTITUDE, MAYBE
CONGRESS IS JUST ATTEMPTING
CANTRIC LAWMAKING.
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE DOING
NOTHING, KEEPING PERFECTLY
STILL, NOTHING HAPPENING.
BUT IN FACT THEY'RE
SKILLFULLY BUILDING UP
LEGISLATION UNTIL IT
EVENTUALLY EXPLODES IN THE
GREATEST LORE OF ALL TIMES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
-- GREATEST LAW OF ALL TIMES!
NOW THIS IS NOT GOOD.
IT'S NOT JUST A VOTING
RIGHTS ACT IN CONGRESS'S
HANDS.
THE IMMIGRATION BILL IS
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.
IT'S EASY TO DESPAIR AT
THIS.
IS THERE NO MAJOR ISSUE THAT
CONGRESS COULD TACKLE THAT
WOULD STAND A CHANCE OF
PASSING WITH BIPARTISAN
SUPPORT?
>> MR. SPEAKER,-- WOULD
ALLOW THE SECRETARY OF THE
INTERIOR TO CONTINUE THE
SALE OF ELECTRONIC DUCK
STAMPS AND ALSO EXPANDS THE
PROGRAM TO INCLUDE ALL OF
OUR 50 STATES.
>> YES!
(LAUGHTER)
THE BELOVED DUCK STAMPS
FINALLY A WAY TO MAIL MY
DUCKS BACK HOME.
I'M BEING TOLD IT'S ACTUALLY
A HUNTING PERMIT OF SOME
KIND.
BUT MAYBE, MAYBE CONGRESS
CAN REGAIN OUR FAITH IN IT
JUST BY PASSING THIS BUN
INCREDIBLY NARROW BILL
ENABLING PEOPLE TO BUY DUCK
STAMPS ELECTRONICALLY IN ALL
50 STATES.
DO YOU BELIEVE, BOYS AND
GIRLS?
DO YOU?
DO YOU?
>> THE YEAS ARE 401, THE
NAYS ARE 0, THAI THIRDS
VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE,
THE RAWLS ARE SUSPENDED.
THE BILL IS PASSED!
>> THIS IS THE ONE!
THE SYSTEM WORKS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THAT IS SUCH A RELIEF.
WHEN IT COMES TO PASSING
BORDERLINE MEANINGLESS
LEGISLATION, YOU ARE THE
BEST AROUND!
SO CONGRESS, HERE'S A
TRIBUTE TO YOU FOR BEING
ABLE TO DO THE THINGS THAT
DON'T NEED DOING ♪ YOU'RE
THE BEST AROUND ♪
♪.
>> HR-1157, THE BILL TO
INSURANCE PUBLIC ACCESS TO
THE SUMMIT OF RATTLESNAKE
MOUNTAIN.
>> THE BILL IS PASSED.
>> THE BILL TO DIRECT THE
SECRETARY OF STATE TO
DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO OBTAIN
OBSERVER STATUS FOR TAIWAN.
>> HR-251, A BILL TO DIRECT
THE SECRETARY OF THE
INTERIOR TO CONVEY CERTAIN
FEDERAL FEATURES OF THE
ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
TO THE SOUTH UTAH VALLEY
ELECTRIC SERVICE DISTRICT
AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.
>> THE BILL IS PASSED.
>>
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
