[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES AND SMALL BUSINESSES NEVER HAVE AN EASY GO OF IT BUT IN
THIS CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE IT'S BEEN ESPECIALLY UNKIND TO SMALL BUSINESS.
JASON JONES FILED THIS REPORT.
>> DENVER, COLORADO, JEWEL OF THE ROCKIES.
IT'S A BIG CITY THAT HAS MAINTAINED IT'S SMALL TOWN APPEAL BY KEEPING THE CHARACTER
OF LOCAL BUSINESSES ALIVE.
BUSINESSES LIKE JASON'S DELTA 9.
>> WE PUT A LOT OF LOVE INTO OUR PRODUCT BECAUSE WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE WHICH IS THE KEY.
>> HE RUNS THIS CHARMING MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARY IN DOWNTOWN INSIDE THIS QUAINT CONCRETE STOREFRONT.
BUT HIS LIVELIHOOD IS THREATENED BY A RASH OF NEW COMPETITION LIKE THIS 20,000 SQUARE FOOT
WEED SUPERSTORE THAT OPENED JUST UP THE STREET.
IT'S A POT PALACE OFFERING HUNDREDS OF VARIETIES OF EXOTIC CAN BUS TO SERVE DENVER'S SICK
POPULATION AT ROCK BOTTOM PRICES.
THEY ARE NOT JUST SELLING MEDICINE THEY ARE SELLING A LIFESTYLE TO 24 CAR YACHT GOLD
MEDICAL ACCESSORIES TO OTHER THINS.
>> THIS IS OUR WELLNESS ROOM.
THE MASSAGE ROOM AND CHIROPRACTIC TABLE WHERE PEOPLE GET ADJUSTMENTS.
>> IT MAY BE TOO MUCH FOR JASON.
>> SOME OF THE PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PLANT AND THEY ARE AFTER THE BUCK.
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE THEY ARE MAYBE TRYING TO PUT SMALLER MOM AND POP STORE LIKE YOURS OUT OF BUSINESS.
IT'S HAPPENING LEFT AND RIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY.
>> HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN BUSINESS?
>> FOUR MONTHS.
>> HIS FOUR LONG MONTHS OF WORK IS JEOPARDIZED.
>> THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT GOT INTO THE INDUSTRY HAVING A HARD TIME.
>> THEY ARE ALL STONED.
>> IT'S MEDICATED.
>> SORRY.
MEDICATED.
>> AND JOHNNY-COME-LATELIES LIKE SCOTT OWNER OF APOT CAREY OF COLORADO ARE USING THE MOST
USELESS -- RUTHLESS TACTICS AVAILABLE.
>> EVERYTHING IN HERE IS INFUSED WITH POT, CANDY BARS, LOLLIPOPS,
EVERYTHING IS MADE OF POP.
EVERYTHING SKWROFRPBG POTENT.
--
>> POTENT.
>> IT'S PART OF PLAN TO DOMINATE THE MARKET.
>> IT'S VICIOUS COMPETITION.
PEOPLE HAVE TO GO.
>> IT'S BLOOD ON YOU, SIR.
>> IT'S NOT BLOOD IT'S BUSINESS.
IF YOU ARE A DISPENSARY AND YOU WANT PATIENT AND I WANT THE SAME PATIENT, IT'S WHO IS OFFERING
THE BEST SERVICES.
WE'RE IN THE IN IT TO GET PEOPLE HIGH.
>> GETTING MEDICATED.
>> IT'S ALL THE SAME.
>> IT'S NOT THE SAME FOR HIM.
>> WE'RE NOT PUSHING THE COMMODITY.
IT'S ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT.
PRODUCTS THAT HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME LIKE AK-47, TRAIN WRECK AND GREEN CRACK BUT BIG
POT EVEN WANTS TO CHANGE THAT.
>> THE STRAIN IS PRODUCTIVE.
>> THESE ARE CLASSIC NAMES.
>> GREEN CRACK.
>> NO ONE WANTS THAT WE CALL IT GREEN FUZZY BUNNY.
YOU ARE TAKING AWAY THE LINEAGE OF THE STRAIN.
IT'S GOOD MEDICINE.
>> JUST LIKE REGULAR CRACK.
>> YOU SAY THOSE WORDS.
YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT IN FRONT OF YOUR DAUGHTER AND SON.
THERE'S RESPONSIBILITY.
>> IT'S BETTER TO SMOKE YOUR KID UP ON BROWN FLUFFY BUNNIES.
>> HELL, YEAH.
>> ISN'T IT LIKE BIG POT TO TAKE THE SAME DRUG, CHANGE THE NAME AND SELL IT FOR $5 MORE.
THIS PROFESSIONAL POT REVIEWER SEES THIS BATTLE AS HEALTHY COMPETITION.
EA AGREED TO SPEAK WITH US ON THE CONDITION THAT WE CONCEAL HIS IDENTITY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> I DON'T THINK I CAN KEEP DOING THIS SO WE'LL DO SOMETHING ELSE TO YOUR FACE.
[COUGHING]
>> PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR DIFFER THINGS OUT OF DIFFERENT SHOPS.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO RUN OUT AND GRAB A McDONALDS CHEESEBURGER AND SOME PEOPLE
WANT TO GO TO A STEAKHOUSE.
>> NOW MY HAND IS CUBED.
>> WHILE IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE CONFLICT WILL BE RESOLVED THE
ONE THING THAT IS CLEAR IS:  OH,
MY GOD LOOK AT HOW MUCH POT YOU CAN LEGALLY BUY IN DENVER.
>> EVE||||
