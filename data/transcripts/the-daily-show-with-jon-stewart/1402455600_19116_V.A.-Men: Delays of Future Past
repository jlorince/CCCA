>> Jon: HI. WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW." I'M JON STEWART.
GOOD SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, SEBASTIANJUNGER. HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE
NEW DOCUMENTARY "KORENGAL,"AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED
ABOUT THAT. IT'S THE FOLLOW UPTO "RESTREPO,"
WHICH YOU ALL REMEMBER.
BUT FIRST, YOU KNOW, WE KNOWABOUT THE V.A. BACKLOG AND HOW
PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISEDTO FIX IT BACK THERE IN,
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT, OT 8.AND HOW BEFORE THAT, GEORGE BUSH
HAD PROMISED TO FIX IT. ANDBEFORE THAT, WELL I GUESS
IT COULD BE SUMMED UP BYHARRY S. TRUMAN,
HARRY S. TRUMAN WHO SAID IN1945, THIS IS TRUE,
FIVE WEEKS AFTER HE TOOK OVERFOR FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT,
WHO HAD DIED OF A BRAINHEMORRHAGE AFTER HE TRIED TO
WRAP HIS MIND AROUND THE V.A.
F.D.R., POLIO, NO PROBLEM.
DEPRESSION, NO PROBLEM.
HITLER, TOJO, NO PROBLEM.
THE V.A.?
ANYWAY, AS HARRY TRUMAN SAID,"THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION
WILL BE MODERNIZED AS SOON ASPOSSIBLE, BUT I CAN'T DO IT
IMMEDIATELY."
[LAUGHTER]TRUMAN!
THE GUY WHO WAS ABLE TO HARNESSTHE POWER OF THE ATOM.
THE GUY WITH WHOM THE BUCK STOPSCOULDN'T MAKE A DENT IN THE V.A.
WELL, THE V.A.'S GOTTEN AWAYWITH IT FOR A PRETTY LONG TIME.
GUESS WHAT, FACELESSBUREAUCRACY?
YOU JUST STEPPED IN [BLEEPED]CREEK WITHOUT A CAN OF WHOOP
ASS.
[LAUGHTER]GOT TO GET BETTER AT METAPHORS.
BECAUSE ALL YOUR SHENANIGANSATTRACTED SOME WHAT I THINK
YOU'LL FIND IS UNWANTEDATTENTION.
>> MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AREHOLDING A RARE NIGHTTIME HEARING
TO TACKLE ONE OF THE BIGGESTSCANDALS TO EVER HIT THE
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.
>> Jon: OH [BLEEPED], YOU'RE INTROUBLE NOW, MOTHER [BLEEPED].
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]CONGRESS IS HOLDING A HEARING ON
YOUR ASS. AND NOT JUST HEARING,A NIGHT HEARING.
CONGRESS AFTER DARK.
[LAUGHTER]WHEN YOUR TYPICAL DO-NOTHING,
BUMBLING CONGRESS TRANSFORMSINTO BAT-CONGRESS.
I'M BAT-CONGRESS.
TO THE LOW APPROVAL RATINGMOBILE.
>> A LOT OF THE EQUIPMENT, THETECHNOLOGY THAT THE VETERANS
HAVE IS OUTDATED.
COULD THAT AFFECT PART OF THESCHEDULING PROBLEMS?
>> Jon: HMM.
WHAT AN APT NON-GRANDSTANDYQUESTION, DELIVERED IN A SUBDUED
MANNER.
INTERESTING.
OBVIOUSLY TECHNOLOGY CHANGESRAPIDLY.
THE SYSTEMS ARE PROBABLYSLIGHTLY OUT OF DATE THERE.
THAT COULD HAVE AN EFFECT.
PERHAPS THE V.A.'S LAPTOPS ANDiPAD ARE STILL RUNNING ON
PANTHER WHEN THEY SHOULD BERUNNING ON O.S. MAVERICK.
ANSWER THE QUESTION.
>> OUR SCHEDULING SYSTEMSCHEDULED ITS FIRST APPOINTMENT
IN APRIL OF 1985.
IT HAS NOT CHANGED IN ANYAPPRECIABLE MANNER SINCE THAT
DATE.
[AUDIENCE REACTS][LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, IS THEV.A. REPRESENTED BY ONE OF THE
UNDEAD?
SECOND OF ALL...
[LAUGHTER][SPEAKING IN A ROBOTIC VOICE]:
IT HAS NOT CHANGED.
IT STILL WANTS BRAINS.
BUT SERIOUSLY THOUGH, 1985?
YOU'RE RUNNING O.S. TANDY1000.
YOUR SYSTEM CAN'T PROCESSCLAIMS, BUT IT CAN PRINT AN
ALL-TEXT PICTURE OF SNOOPY.
1985?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
HAVE YOU EVER SAW THE MOVIE "THENET" ON LATE-NIGHT CABLE AND
LAUGHED OUT LOUD ALONE ABOUT HOWOUTDATED THE TECHNOLOGY SEEMS?
>> THIS WAS FALSE ALARM.
O.
>> YES.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: THAT'S TEN YEARS MORE
ADVANCED THAN WHAT THE V.A. ISCURRENTLY USING.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]I MEAN, THAT'S POW. WHAT?
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:WHERE'S THE OFFICE OF THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL ON THIS?
DOES THE V.A. HAVE AN INSPECTORGENERAL, OR IS IT JUST A PUMPKIN
IN HAT?
COME ON!
ISSUE A REPORT.
>> SINCE 2005, THE O.I.G. HASISSUED 18 REPORTS THAT
IDENTIFIED AT BOTH THE NATIONALAND LOCAL LEVEL DEFICIENCIES IN
SCHEDULING RESULTING IN LENGTHYWAIT TIMES AND A NEGATIVE IMPACT
ON PATIENT CARE.
>> Jon: OH.
THAT'S TWO REPORTS A YEAR ON THEPROBLEM.
CONGRESS, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHINGTO SAY ON THAT?
>> MR. GRIFFIN?
SIR, IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOUSTATED THAT THE O.I.G. HAS
ISSUED 18 REPORTS THAT IDENTIFYDEFICIENCIES IN SCHEDULING
WITHIN THE V.A. SINCE 2005.
CAN YOU ELABORATE ON SOME OF THERECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED
WITHIN YOUR REPORTS?
>> Jon: OH, ELABORATE ON THEM.
WELL, THERE'S 18 OF THEM.
IT SOUNDS PRETTY [BLEEPED]ELABORATE. I UMM,
SIR, I KNOW YOU'VE SENT THEREPORTS TO CONGRESS, AND I'M IN
CONGRESS, BUT THERE'S SOMETHINGI NEED TO TELL YOU.
[WHISPERING]: I CAN'T READ.
I'M SO ASHAMED.
WHENEVER I GO OUT THE EAT, IHAVE TO GO TO DENNY'S BECAUSE I
HAVE TO POINT TO THE PICTURES.
[LAUGHTER]IT'S JUST GRAND SLAM AFTER GRAND
SLAM.
>> DID THOSE I.G. REPORTS NEVERMAKE IT TO YOU?
>> IN RESPONSE TO THAT G.A.O.
REPORT, WE WENT BACK AND LOOKEDAT HOW WE COMPUTED THE WAIT
TIMES FOR VETERANS WHO ARE NEWTO A CLINIC.
>> CAN YOU SAY THAT TODAY THAT'SFAILURE?
WHAT YOU GUYS DID AT ANINTERMEDIARY LEVEL WAS FAILURE.
>> I WOULD SAY WE DID NOT KNOWAT THAT POINT IN TIME,
CONGRESSWOMAN, THE NATURE ANDTHE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM.
>> Jon: [WHISPERING]: I'MGOING TO KILL SOMEBODY.
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME VISUALREPRESENTATION OF HOW
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MESS ISBATTED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN
CONGRESS AND THE V.A. PERHAPSUSING TECHNOLOGY THE V.A.
WOULD BE COMFORTABLE OPERATING.OH, HERE GO. I READ THE
REPORT. AND DIDN'T. PERHAPS YOUCAN READ THE REPORT. AND OH,
MAYBE IF WE ALL READ THE REPORTSAND THEN WE CAN GO THROUGH.
BUT CONGRESS IS REALLY THEISSUE.
[LAUGHTER][BEEP]
I USED TO PLAY THAT FOR HOURS.[BEEP]
CAN'T WE FIGURE OUT SOME --[LAUGHTER]
CAN'T WE FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TOUSE THAT DEATH DRONE N.S.A.
TECHNOLOGY FOR ADMINISTRATIVEPURPOSES AT THE V.A.?
WHAT'S CAPTAIN AMERICA DOINGWHEN HE'S NOT FIGHTING?
CAN HE HELP?
THIS GUY, RIGHT HERE, BOOM.
JUST GIVE HIM AN AMERICAN-THEMEDCLIPBOARD OR AN iPAD AND LET
HIM AT THE BACKLOG.
>> MEN, YOUR WAIT TIMES AREOVER.
I'M TAKING YOU ALL TO SEEDOCTORS.
>> THEY SAID THERE WERE NOAVAILABLE APPOINTMENTS FOR EIGHT
MONTHS.
>> WELL, THERE'S A NEW UNDERSECRETARY OF HEALTH MANAGEMENT
IN TOWN.
>> WE'RE ALL GOING TO GETMEDICINE.
REGULAR HEALTH CHECK-UPS HERE ICOME.
GO TO HELL, BACKLOG!
>> Jon: REFORM!
