WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH, TONIGHT'S PROGRAM, MY
GUEST TONIGHT, OH, I'M VERY
EXCITED ABOUT THIS, NO ONE.
(LAUGHTER)
WE DO NOT HAVE A GUEST
TONIGHT.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO, I'M
JUST GOING SIT FOR FIVE, SIX
MINUTES AND JUST STARE.
(LAUGHTER)
ACTUALLY WE DON'T HAVE A
GUEST TONIGHT BECAUSE WE DO
HAVE A BLOCKBUSTER TWO-PART
INVESTIGATION BY OUR OWN
JOHN OLVER THAT YOU DO NOT
WANT TO MISS.
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON AT
THE END OF HIS EXPOSE HE WE
ARE GIVING AWAY A VAN.
CHAERS PLAUS THAT DOES NOT
LONG TO US.
(LAUGHTER)
SO THE WINNER WILL RECEIVE A
STOLEN VAN.
(LAUGHTER)
I HAVE 20 MINUTES TO STEAL A
VAN.
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT, NO VAN.
BUT FIRST, I AM SICK OF THE
ELECTIONS.
I WANT TO START WITH A STORY
OF INTERNATIONAL INTRIGUE.
>> SYRIAN DICTATOR ASSAD HIS
PERSONAL E-MAILS WERE LEAKED
TO THE BRITISH NEWSPAPER
GUARDIANCE.
>> BRITIAN FWAURDIAN
NEWSPAPER SAID IT OBTAINED
THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS TO AND
FROM PRESIDENT BASHAR ASSAD.
>> Jon: FINALLY, AN E-MAIL
HACK OF SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY
DESERVES TO HAVE THEIR
E-MAIL HACKED.
THANK GOD.
(APPLAUSE)
ENOUGH WITH THE HACKING OF
THE-- I DON'T REMEMBER LARRY
KING BEING A VICTIM OF THAT.
THAT-- OH, RIGHT, I REMEMBER
THAT.
I REMEMBER THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT WAS-- I IMAGINE THE
MASS RESPONSE TO ANYBODY
WATCHING THE SHOW NOW IS
LIKE EVERYBODY TAKING THE
CINNAMON CHALLENGE AT ONCE.
AH!
AH!
ALL RIGHT.
THERE WE GO.
THANK YOU.
BASHAR AL-ASSAD.
THE SYRIAN DICTATOR
CURRENTLY 12 MONTHS INTO A
MASSACRE OF HIS OWN
CITIZENS.
IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEONE
REVEALED HIS SECRETARY RED
TACTICS AND WEAKNESSES.
>> MORE THAN 3,000 E-MAILS
REVEAL THAT THE SYRIAN
STRONGMAN IS HOOKED ON
iTUNES.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THIS GUY MASSACRES
HIS OWN PEOPLE WITH IMPUNITY
BUT MAKES SURE HE PURCHASES
HIS MUSIC LEGALLY?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I'LL TAUNT NATO AND
THE WORLD COMMUNITY BUT EVEN
I WON'T [BLEEP] WITH APPLE.
>> ASSAD DOWNLOADED VIDEO
IMGAS, MOVIES, APPS AND
TUNES BY LMFAO, CHRIS BROWN
AND EVEN COUNTRY STAR BLAKE
SHELTON.
>> Jon: WOW.
HE DOWNLOADS CHRIS BROWN.
I HOPE THE ASSOCIATION WITH
AN UNAPOLOGETICALLY VIOLENT
BRUTE DOESN'T HURT ASSAD'S
REPUTATION.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT ON THIS
GUY?
>> WE HAVE SOME OF THE
SNIPPETS FROM THESE
REVEALING E-MAILS.
ASSAD'S WIFE WRITES IN LATE
NOVEMBER, ARE YOU COMING
AROUND THE SECOND OR BEFORE.
IF SO, PLEASE CAN YOU BRING
THE HARRY POTTER DEATHLY
HALLOWS PART 2 RELEASED ON
THE SECOND OF DECEMBER.
>> Jon: SO ASSAD WANTED
HARRY POTTER MOVIES OR AS HE
PROBABLY REFERS TO THEM, THE
VOLDEMORT CHRONICLES AND HIS
STRUGGLE TO OVERCOME THE BOY
WITHOUT CAN'T BE NAMED.
I GOT TO TELL YOU, IF
DICTATORS ARE GOING TO USE
E-MAIL IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE
THIS.
HEY, YOU, COME OVER.
I'M GRILLING SOME CHICKEN,
LOL, DAMN YOU AUTO CORRECT.
KILLING SOME CITIZENS.
ROTFL, REALLY OPPRESSING
FREEDOM AND LIBERTY.
YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH, WE
STRUGGLED TO FIGURE OUT AN
EMOTICON THAT A DICTATOR
WOULD USE.
I AM GLAD THE INTERNET
WASN'T INVENTED IN HITLER'S
TIME.
I IMAGINE EVA
