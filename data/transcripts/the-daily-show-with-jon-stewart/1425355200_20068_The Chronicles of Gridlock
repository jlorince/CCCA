[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, THE GREATROBERT SMIGEL WILL BE JOINING US
ON TONIGHT'S PROGRAM.
[APPLAUSE]NOW, EARLIER TONIGHT, AFTER THIS
TAPING BUT BEFORE THE AIRING OFTHIS PROGRAM, I WAS ON MONDAY
NIGHT RAW, WHICH IS THE WWWRESTLING SHOW, I WAS THERE TO
FULFILL A FEUD, A VERY, A VERYREAL AND POWERFUL FEUD THAT
I'M HAVING WITH A WRESTLER.
SO TONIGHT I GOT IN THE RINGWITH, WITH, WITH PROFESSIONAL
SETH ROLLINS SO I CAN ONLYASSUME THAT THIS IS THE BEFORE
PICTURE, AND BY THE TIME YOU SEETHIS, I WILL HAVE BEEN
ROYALLY [BLEEP] UP.
BECAUSE I'M AN OLD MAN WHO HASNO BUSINESS DOING ANY OF THIS.
[LAUGHTER]NOW YOU MAY REMEMBER BACK WHEN
DEMOCRATS CONTROLLED THE SENATE,THE REPUBLICANS CONTROLLED THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,NOTHING GOT DONE.
GRIDLOCK RULED THE DAY.
BUT AFTER THE REPUBLICANS WHATDO YOU CALL IT THERE -- RED
WEDDING'D THE DEMOCRATS LASTNOVEMBER, THE OUTLOOK CHANGED.
>> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOW HASAN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THAT WE
CAN ACTUALLY GOVERN.
>> WE WILL GET THINGS DONE.
>> WE ACTUALLY CAN WORK TOACCOMPLISH THINGS.
>> THIS GRIDLOCK AND DYSFUNCTIONCAN BE ENDED.
>> I'M SO HAPPY.
[LAUGHTER]REPUBLICANS NOW RUN BOTH THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THESENATE.
WHICH MEANS BARACK OBAMA NOWFACES THE UNSTOPPABLE TAG TEAM
OF JOHN BOEHNER AND MITCHMCCONNELL OR AS THEY WERE KNOWN
IN THEIR OLD COP SHOW:TURTLE AND CARROT.
TURTLE WAS THE STRAIGHT ARROW,ALWAYS PLAYED BY THE RULES.
CARROT WAS A LOOSE CANNON WHOWAS A GREAT SOURCE OF VITAMIN A
AND DIETARY FIBER.
NOW THESE TWO POWERFULREPUBLICANS ARE PERFECTLY --
[LAUGHTER]THAT'S HOW EVERY EPISODE ENDED
BY THE WAY.
BUT THEY'RE PERFECTLY POISED TOPASSED A LITANY OF LEGISLATION
AND I'M EXCITED FOR ONE TO SEEHOW WELL IT GOES.
>> BUT THE REPUBLICANS MAINTAINTHAT THE PLAN OVERSTEPS THE
PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY,AND THEY'VE THREATENED TO BLOCK
FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENTOF HOMELAND SECURITY UNLESS
THE IMMIGRATION ACTIONS AREREPEALED.
>> Jon:  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?YOU'RE BLOCKING DHS FUNDING FOR
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXECUTIVEIMMIGRATION ACTION.
SO TO STOP THE PRESIDENT FROMBEING TOO LENIENT ON ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION YOU WANT TO DEFUNDTHE DEPARTMENT THAT SECURES THE
BORDER? [LAUGHTER]
THAT'S REALLY LIKE SAYING YOUKNOW, YOU KIDS ARE TOO HORNY
AND OVERSEXED SO YOUR MOTHERAND I HAVE DECIDED TO
TAKE AWAY ALL OF YOUR CLOTHES.
FROM NOW ON, IF YOUR FRIEND WANTTO VISIT YOU THEY'VE GOT TO DO
IT IN OUR BASEMENT ON THE COUCHWITHOUT SUPERVISION NEXT TO THE
LIQUOR CABINET WHILE THIS BARRYWHITE ALBUM IS PLAYING.
[LAUGHTER]
REPUBLICANS, HOW CAN YOU GAMBLEWITH HOMELAND SECURITY?
HOW CAN YOU GAMBLE WITH HOMELANDSECURITY, REPUBLICANS, AS SCARED
AS YOU ARE?
>> THE TRUTH IS THERE ARE PEOPLETHAT WAKE UP EVERY DAY WHOSE
INTENTION IS TO TRY TO KILLAMERICANS.
>> THESE ARE BARBARIANS.
THEY INTEND TO KILL US.
>> THEY HAVE SAID THAT THEY WILLUSE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
>> ISIS.>> NORTH KOREA.
>> AL-QAEDA.
>> IRAN >> EBOLA.
>> THIS PRESIDENT NEEDS TO ARISETO THE OCCASION BEFORE WE ALL
GET KILLED BACK HERE AT HOME.
>> Jon:  WE'RE ALL GOING TODIE.
BY THE WAY YOU CAN FIND THAT ANDMORE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
MAGAZINE UNDERGROUND BUNKERSQUARTERLY.
LOT OF GOOD IDEAS FOR URINE INTHAT MAGAZINE.
[LAUGHTER]NOW THERE'S NO WAY DEMOCRATS
WILL PASS A BILL THAT UNDOES THEPRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ACTION ON
IMMIGRATION,
SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO BREAKTHIS IMPASSE?
>> MAJORITY LEADER MITCHMCCONNELL BROKE AN IMPASSE
WEDNESDAY.
HE PUT LANGUAGE TO BLOCKPRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE
ACTION ON IMMIGRATION IN ASEPARATE BILL.
>> Jon:  IMPASSE BROKEN.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE THESE GUYS ARE READY TOGOVERN.
>> IT'S EFFECTIVELY DEAD ONARRIVAL RIGHT NOW IN THE HOUSE.
HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GIVINGIN THE WAY SENATE REPUBLICANS
DID.
>> Jon:  AND THERE WE HAVE IT.
[LAUGHTER]BUT THIS FINALLY ANSWERS THE
QUESTION, WHERE IS THE TURDCLOGGING OUR LEGISLATIVE
PLUMBING?
THEY'RE CALLED HOUSEREPUBLICANS.
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING WAS GOINGTO RUN SMOOTHLY IF WE HAD A
REPUBLICAN SENATE TO WORKWITH THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE.
TURNS OUT NO ONE CAN WORK WITHTHE REPUBLICAN HOUSE.
THEY'RE THE KEITH OLBERMANN OFCONGRESSES.
[LAUGHTER]WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR NEW
SEGMENT MEET THE [BLEEP].SO THE SCARITIEST BRANCH OF OUR
GOVERNMENT THE HOUSE OFREPUBLICANS ARE THE ONES WHO
WILL SHUT DOWN THE HOMELANDSECURITY.
BUT THEIR VAUNTED LEADER JOHNBOEHNER TREATS THE HOUSE
REPUBLICANS OBSTINANCE WITHTHE SERIOUSNESS IT DESERVES.
>> IF DEPARTMENT OF HOMELANDSECURITY FUNDING RUNS OUT ON
FRIDAY NIGHT, ARE WE LESS SAFEAS A NATION.
>> IF IFS AND BUTS WERE CANDYAND NUTS, EVERY DAY WOULD BE
CHRISTMAS.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon:  OKAY.
NUMBER ONE OBVIOUSLY I GREW UPJEWISH AND NOT COMPLETELY FLUENT
IN THE RITUALS OF YOU'RECHRISTMAS HOLIDAY, BUT I'M
PRETTY SURE NOBODY WAKES UP AT5:30AM AND SNEAKS DOWNSTAIRS TO
MAKE SURE SANTA BROUGHT THEMPECANS AND JUJUBEES.
I MEAN, I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVEGOTTEN CHRISTMAS MIXED UP WITH
HALLOWEEN AND SOME HOLIDAY WHEREPEOPLE BRING YOU NUTS.
SECOND OF ALL, THISDISMISSIVENESS THAT YOU DISPLAY
IS SOMEWHAT DISCONNECTED FROMTHE SERIOUSNESS OF THAT
QUESTION.
SO I'M GOING TO LET YOU TRYAGAIN.
>> IT'S GOING TO BE A CLEAN DHSFUNDING BILL.
ARE YOU GOING TO PUT IT ON THEFLOOR? ARE YOU GOING TO KILL IT?
ARE YOU GOING TO LET THEM VOTEON IT?
HAVE YOU EVEN HAD THISDISCUSSION?
[LAUGHTER]>> IFS AND BUTTS ARE TERRIBLE
ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS, WHAT AREYOU DOING?
THE ONLY QUESTION WOULD HAVEBEEN AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO
IS SPEAKER BOEHNER, WOULD YOUMIND LETTING THE ENTIRE PRESS
CORPS KNOW HOW YOU CALLYOUR CAT?
[LAUGHTER]THIS GUY IS DROPPING RHYMES AND
MAKING KISSY FACES TO THE PRESS.
EITHER MENTALLY JOHN BOEHNER'S AFEW SEATS SHORT OF A MAJORITY.
OR HE'S GOT SUCH AN AMAZING PLANHE CAN AFFORD TO BE
OVERCONFIDENT TO THEPOINT OF WEIRDNESS.
>> THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A VOTETO HAVE A STOP GAP FUNDING
MEASURE TO KEEP THE DEPARTMENTRUNNING FOR THREE WEEKS.
>> Jon:  THAT'S THE PLAN?
[LAUGHTER]THREE WEEKS STOP GAP PLAN.
THAT'S THE PLAN THAT ALLOWED YOUTO BE SO COCKY WITH
EVERYBODY, YOU'RE UP THERE. YOUBELIEVE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
CONVINCE YOUR CAUCUS TO DELAYTHIS PROBLEM A FULL 21 DAYS.
THAT'S WHAT'S GIVING YOU THISSWAGGER.
IT IS MY PLEDGE TO YOU THAT THISCOUNTRY WILL NOT HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THIS HOMELAND SECURITYCRISIS AT LEAST UNTIL
ST. PATRICK'S DAY.
[LAUGHTER]>> HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERS WERE
BLIND SIDED WHEN THEIR PLAN TOPREVENT THE DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY FROM SHUTTINGDOWN WAS DEFEATED.
52 CONSERVATIVES VOTED NOBECAUSE THE FUNDING BILL DIDN'T
ALSO STOP THE PRESIDENT'SIMMIGRATION PLAN.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD, BOEHNER,YOU COULDN'T EVEN GET YOUR OWN
CAUCUS TO GIVE YOUNEXT TO NOTHING.
I DON'T KNOW JOHN, THREE WEEKSEXTENSION DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE IT'S REALLYEMBARRASSING ENOUGH.
IF YOU GIVE US ANOTHER CHANCE WEPROMISE WE CAN MAKE YOUR
HUMILIATION COMPLETE.
HOW LONG DOES A HULUPLUSFREE TRIAL LAST?
[LAUGHTER]LET'S GIVE THAT A SHOT.
>> IN THE END A BILL DID PASS TOFUND THE HOMELAND SECURITY
DEPARTMENT FOR ONE WEEK.
>> Jon:  ONE WEEK.
[LAUGHTER]SO WE GO THROUGH THIS SAME
RIDICULOUS DANCE ON FRIDAY.
IT'S AS THOUGH THE CAUCUS THATYOU JOHN BOEHNER PURPORT TO
CONTROL HAS TOLD YOU TO DO THISTO THEIR ASS.
[LAUGHTER] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
