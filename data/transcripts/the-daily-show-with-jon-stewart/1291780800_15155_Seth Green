ASPECT OF THE PROGRAM WHICH IS
HARD TO DO BECAUSE IT'S USUALLY

TRYING TO BE AN ACTOR AS WELL
AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TIME.
BUT I LOVE THE SHOW.
IT IS -- IT'S FUN IN EVERY WAY.
WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WORK
ON IT THAT ARE REALLY TALENTED.
I DON'T KNOW IT'S KIND OF
EXCITING COMING TOGETHER.

WORDS.
