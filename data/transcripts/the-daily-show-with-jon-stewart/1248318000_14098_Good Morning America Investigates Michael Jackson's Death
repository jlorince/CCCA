>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD BUT A
MONTH AGO AN ENTERTAINMENT BY
THE NAME MICHAEL JACKSON PASSED
AWAY.
THERE WAS SOME REPORTING ON IT.
I BELIEVE THE PARIS REVIEW HAD A
NICE OBIT AND THE BBC FILED A
REPORT.
BUT WE CAME ACROSS A MICHAEL
JACKSON STORY ON "GOOD MORNING
AMERICA."
I KNOW WE CUT TOGETHER MONTAGES
FROM DIFFERENT NETWORKS TO SHOW
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING
BUT THIS ONE "GOOD MORNING
AMERICA" STORY A FEW WEEKS AFTER
HIS DEATH JUST HAD EVERYTHING
YOU COULD EVER WANT FROM A TV
NEWS STORY.
WE THOUGHT LET'S NOT TRY TO
IMPROVE IT.
LET'S JUST PLAY IT SO THAT YOU
AT HOME COULD EXPERIENCE THE JOY
WE FELT WHEN WE WATCHED IT FOR
THE FIRST TIME.
LET ME GET IT UP ON MY TiVo.
HOLD ON.
GET IT UP THERE.
JON, YOU ARE CRAZY TO LEAVE A
GREAT WOMAN LIKE THAT.
ALL RIGHT.
THURSDAY, 7:08 IN THE MORNING,
"GOOD MORNING AMERICA" GIVES YOU
THIS:
AFTER DAYS OF SPECULATION, A
SOURCE CLOSE TO THE JACKSON
FAMILY TELLS ABC NEWS THAT THE
KING OF POP'S BODY IS CURRENTLY
IN THIS CEMETERY.
>> Jon: THE LEAD OF THIS STORY
IS THAT TWO AND A HALF WEEKS
AFTER MICHAEL JACKSON'S DEATH
HIS CORPSE IS IN A CEMETERY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> THIS WAS A VERY UNUSUAL
NOTATION ON A DEATH CERTIFICATE.
HE IS A TEMPORARY VAULT HERE.
WE'RE CERTAIN OF IT.
>> CELEBRITY EXPERT STEVE
GOLDSTEIN BELIEVES --
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: CELEBRITY GRAVE EXPERT
STEVE GOLDSTEIN.
IF THAT IS NOT THE TITLE OF ROB
SNYDER'S -- SNYDER'S NEXT MOVIE,
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A REGULAR
GRAVE EXPERT GOES HOLLYWOOD.
[HUMMING]
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO THE MYSTERY OF MICHAEL
JACKSON'S LOST CORPSE SOLVED.
TIME TO TAKE US DEEPER WITH A
PRODUCTION TRICK.
>> AS FOR THE ONGOING
INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT KILLED
JACKSON QUESTIONS CONTINUE TO
SWIRL.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD MICHAEL'S
KILLER IS IN THAT BAG.
OR THAT IS THAT GUY'S LAUNDRY.
ALL I KNOW IS LOOK AT THAT BAG.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE BAG, OF COURSE, PROPERTY OF
THE MAD GENIUS AT THE CENTER OF
THIS MYSTERY.
>> MICHAEL'S DERMATOLOGIST.
>> I DIDN'T GIVE HIM THE CRAP
THEY TALK B. I HAVE NEVER
PRESCRIBED OXYCONTIN IN MY LIFE.
HOW CAN I PRESCRIBE DIPROVIN
WHEN I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT.
>> Jon: DON'T BLAME ME, I'M
JUST IN CHARGE OF MICHAEL'S
SKIN.
WHAT DID I DO?
OH, NO.
SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT GUY IS
ALSO A LAWYER AND A REAL ESTATE
AGENT.
WHAT ELSE COULD YOU POSSIBLY
WANT TO KNOW IN ONE MICHAEL
JACKSON STORY?
HOW ABOUT THIS?
GOLDSTEIN HAS BEEN TO THE CRYPT
AND TOOK THESE PHOTOS.
>> Jon: EEW.
OR THIS.
>> JOE JACKSON AND GERMANE
DOCTOR JERMAINE JACKSON WANT THE
BODY BURIED ATE NEVERLAND.
HIS MOTHER DOES NOT.
>> Jon: SHE WOULD LIKE TO SELL
THE BONES TO THE ELEPHANT MAN'S
FAMILY.
PAYINTAK A BITCH.
>> A PORTION OF THE BRAIN
REMAINS AT THE L.A. CORONER'S
OFFICE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ONE THING IS FOR SURE, JACKSON
WILL BE BURIED WITH A WHITE
GLOVE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: I THINK IT'S BARELY
POSSIBLE WE'VE HAD ENOUGH
MICHAEL JACKSON DEATH COVERAGE.
THAT'S A GOOD THING.
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING WHO
ELSE BELIEVES THAT THERE'S BEEN
TOO MUCH MICHAEL JACKSON DEATH
COVERAGE.
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE IT.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE WALL-TO-WALL
COVERAGE OF M.J. SINCE HIS DEATH
FURTHER FUELING THE FLAMES OVER
WHAT HAS BECOME A NATIONAL
DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE MEDIA
HAS SPENT TOO MUCH TIME COVERING
MICHAEL JACKSON'S DEATH.
>> Jon: THE BEAST HAS BECOME
SELF AWARE.
LET'S CHASE IT TO THE WINDMILL
AND BURN IT.
HOW SELF-AWARE CAN YOU BE WHEN
THIS IS HOW YOU END THE PIECE.
>> WHERE DID HE WEAR THAT?
WAS IT LUPUS?
WAS HE REALLY TRYING TO HIDE A
DISEASE?
THAT IS COMING UP IN THE NEXT
HALF HOUR.
NOW OVER TO CHRIS
