AND I'M GOING TO.
LOOK, THIS IS OLD.
THIS IS ALL A LOT OF FUN.
THE PROBLEM IS, NEW YORKERS HAVE
TO VOTE FOR A MAYOR IN 48 DAYS.
SO WE NEED TO KNOW HOW LONG AGO
CANDIDATE WEINER FELL OFF THE
DICK WAGON AND WHETHER WE CAN
TRUST HIM AT ALL TO GET BACK ON
IT.
>> SOME HAVE ASKED THE QUESTION,
WHERE DOES THIS FIT IN, A TIME
LINE OF THE CONTINUUM OF THE
RESIGNATION.
SOME OF THESE THINGS HAPPENED
BEFORE MY RESIGNATION.
SOME OF THEM HAPPENED AFTER THE
RESIGNATION.
THE RESIGNATION WAS NOT A POINT
IN TIME THAT WAS NEARLY AS
IMPORTANT TO MY WIFE AND ME AS
THE CHALLENGES IN OUR MARRIAGE.
>> John: IT'S A TIME LINE ISSUE.
IT'S A TIME LINE ISSUE.
IF YOU HADN'T CHOSEN --
CHOSEN -- TO RUN FOR MAYOR, IT
WOULD ONLY BE BETWEEN YOU AND
YOUR WIFE.
BUT FOR THE REST OF US, THE TIME
LINE MEANS EVERYTHING.
SO LET'S REVIEW.
IN JUNE OF 2011, AFTER WE WERE
ALL INTRODUCED TO YOUR PENIS --
WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE.
WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE INTRODUCED.
YES, TECHNICALLY IT WAS STILL IN
ITS WRAPPER, BUT NONETHELESS WE
MET HIM.
FINALLY, AFTER A BUNCH OF
NONSENSE ABOUT YOUR TWITTER
ACCOUNT BEING HACKED, YOU
ADMITTED THAT IT WAS YOU AND
THEN YOU TELL US THIS.
>> THE FIRST THING I NEED TO DO
IS MAKE SURE THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS
NEVER EVER HAPPENS AGAIN.
>> John: RIGHT.
AND THAT IS WHERE YOU DREW THE
PENIS IN THE SAND.
NEVER EVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
AFTER THAT, YOU RESIGNED.
YOUR TIME MOVES ON.
YOUR BULGING JUNK THANKFULLY
SLIPPING INTO EVERYONE'S PAST.
AND THEN IN JULY 2012, YOU AND
YOUR FAMILY EMERGE IN PEOPLE
MAGAZINE WHERE YOU CLAIM TO BE A
CHANGED MAN.
TIME MOVES ON TO THIS PAST
APRIL.
>> BACK IN APRIL WHEN WEINER
ANNOUNCED CANDIDACY FOR NEW YORK
MAYOR HE SAID MORE ALLEGATIONS
COULD EMERGE.
>> IF ROTTERS WANT TO GO TRY TO
FIND MORE, I CAN'T SAY THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
FIND ANOTHER PICTURE.
>> John: AND THAT'S OKAY.
AS LONG AS ANY PICTURES THAT
EMERGE DATE FROM BEFORE HIS
PLEDGE TO STOP SEXT-ING.
IN JUNE, 2011B.C. WHICH MEANS
BEFORE CONFESSION OR BEFORE
[BLEEP], WHICHEVER YOU PREFER,
WHICHEVER YOU PREFER.
SO WHEN YESTERDAY THIS
EMERGED... (LAUGHING)... IT WAS
A PROBLEM.
BECAUSE LOOK.
LOOK AT THE DATE.
LOOK AT WHEN HE SENDS THESE
PHOTOS.
>> WEINER SAID HE CONTINUED
SENDING INAPPROPRIATE MESSAGES
TO YOUNG WOMEN LONG AFTER
RESIGNING IN THE SCANDAL TWO
YEARS AGO.
>> ACCORDING TO THE WEBSITE THE
RELATIONSHIP STARTED JUST ONE
WEEK BEFORE THIS PEOPLE MAGAZINE
PROFILE OF HIM AND HIS FAMILY
RAN WITH THE HEADLINE, "I FEEL
LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON."
>> John: AND THAT IS WHY YOU
HAVE A PROBLEM HERE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
UNLESS, UNLESS, UNLESS IN HIS
DEFENSE, UNLESS WHAT YOU SAID "I
FEEL LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON"
YOU MEANT FROM MY WIFE.
I FEEL LIKE HAVING A DIFFERENT
PERSON FROM THE ONE YOU SEE
FORCING A SMILE NEXT TO ME IN
THIS PHOTOGRAPH.
SO THE DISGUSTING DETAILS OF
THIS STORY ARE A PROBLEM FOR
WEINER, BUT THEY'RE ALSO A
PROBLEM FOR THE NEWSIES TRYING
TO COVER THEM.
>> MOST OF THE EXCHANGE IS TOO
GRAPHIC FOR NETWORK TELEVISION.
>> John: YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT HERE'S THE THING.
WE'RE NOT ON NETWORK TELEVISION.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THIS IS BASIC CABLE, MY FRIENDS.
AND SURE WE MAY BE BLEEPD BUT WE
WILL NOT BE EMBARRASSED OR
SILENCED.
WHAT I'M ACTUALLY ALLOWED TO
READ THESE EXCHANGES I'M NOT
PHYSICALLY ABLE TO DO IT.
THEY'RE JUST TOO REVOLTING WHICH
IS WHY WE HAVE A SPECIAL
COMPUTER TEXT-TO-VOICE MACHINE.
THE PERVERT-TRON5000.
READ THE FIRST UPSETTING TEXT
MESSAGE.
>> I START TO [BLEEP] SO HARD.
YOUR [BLEEP] ALMOST HIT YOU IN
THE FACE.
>> John: HOW IS IS THAT EVEN
SEXY?
THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL LACK OF
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT BREASTS
CAN DO.
THEN I'M GOING TO TAKE ONE OF
YOUR BOOBS AND SPANK YOU WITH
IT, YEAH.
THEN WE GO TO SLEEP SO I LAY ONE
OF YOUR BOOBS ON THE WINDOW SILL
TO KEEP OUT THE COLD AIR.
SEXY.
AND BY THE WAY, THE MAINSTREAM
NEWS CAN SAY... THEY CAN
ACTUALLY SAY THE WORDS THAT
WEINER TEXTED.
THEY'VE ALREADY SAID ALL OF THEM
JUST NOT IN THE RIGHT HORRIBLE
ORDER.
>> ARE YOU.
PUT ON.
SOME SHOES.
I WOULDN'T SPREAD YOUR.
ASS.
SO MY.
[BLEEP].
BLEEP.
John: YOU DID IT.
YOU REPORTED THE NEWS.
YOU SAY THE WORDS MORE THAN YOU
EVER KNOW.
WHAT IS CLEAR AT THIS POINT IS
THIS IS BEYOND JUST A SERIES OF
JOKES.
NO, IT IS IS DEFINITELY ALSO
THAT.
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING MORE
SERIOUS.
>> HE NEEDS TO BE IN CONTINUAL
TREATMENT.
>> SOME SORT OF COMPULSIVE
BEHAVIOR.
>> THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS
ADDICTIVE ABOUT HIS PERSONALITY.
>> John: I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT.
ANTHONY WEINER DOES SUFFER FROM
A DEBILITATING ADDICTION BUT
IT'S NOT THE ONE THEY'RE
THINKING OF.
HE'S ADDICTED TO RUNNING FOR
OFFICE.
AND IF HE COULD JUST GIVE THAT
UP, HE COULD LIVE A FULL,
PRODUCTIVE LIFE AS AN INTERNET
SEX FREAK.
WE'LL BE RIGHT
