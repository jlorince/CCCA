TO THE IRAQ WAR -- I THINK.(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT. DOESN'T REALLY WORKON ANYONE.
BUT FIRST!
YOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICANS THEREARE FAT, FAT!
WITH 2016 PRESIDENTIALCANDIDATES.

HOW WILL THIS TWO-TERM SENATOR,THIS EIGHT-TERM REPRESENTATIVE,
THIS FULL-TERM CURMUDGEON BATTLETHE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL CLINTON
MACHINE?
>> LET ME JUST MAKE A BRIEFCOMMENT AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO
TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS.
WE DON'T HAVE AN ENDLESS AMOUNTOF TIME.
I'VE GOT TO GET BACK.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: WITH CHARM!
(LAUGHTER)THAT WAS HIS PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCEMENT.
NOT SO MUCH YES WE CAN AND MORELIKE LET'S JUST GET THIS OVER
WITH.
I'M A BUSY MAN!
BUSY RUNNING AS THEANTI-HILLARY.
SHE'S AN ESTABLISHMENT CENTRIST,HE'S AN UNAPOLOGETIC LEFTIST.
HER CAMPAIGN IS MANAGED TO A T!
HE FORGOT HIS COMB!
(LAUGHTER)SHE HAS ALMOST 100% NAME
RECOGNITION!
HE IS SOMEWHAT LESSER KNOWN!
(LAUGHTER)SHE HAS A PRIVATE SERVER IN HER
HOME WHERE SHE DELETED TENS OFTHOUSANDS OF HER OWN E-MAILS.
HE OWNS A VHS COPY OF TOOTSIE.
(LAUGHTER)
HE HAS A SET OF CONSISTENTPRINCIPLES
HE HAS RUN ON HIS ENTIREPOLITICAL LIFE.
SHE...
IS GOING TO CRUSH HIM!
(LAUGHTER)THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN STOP
HER!
NOTHING THAT CAN POSSIBLY DERAILOR UNDERMINE OR --
>> AT LEAST 181 CLINTONFOUNDATION DONORS LOBBIED THE
STATE DEPARTMENT AT THE SAMETIME THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS
RUNNING IT.
>> THE CLINTONS DID NOT LIVE UPTO THEIR PROMISE TO DISCLOSE ALL
FOREIGN DONATIONS.
>> NOW THE FOUNDATION HAS HAD TOREFILE FIVE YEARS OF TAX RETURNS
BECAUSE AT LEAST THREE OF THOSEYEARS THEY REPORTED ZERO
DONATIONS FROM FOREIGNGOVERNMENTS WHEN IN FACT THERE
WERE TENS OF MILLIONS OFDOLLARS.
>> Jon: WHAT!
BUT THAT'S OKAY...
THAT'S EASY MISTAKE.
THE ZERO TO TENS OF MILLIONS.
I COULD -- THAT'S AN EASY MIXUP.
WHAT PROBABLY HAPPENED THERE ISAS YOU WERE DOING IT THERE, LIKE
OKAY, 10 MILLION, YOU PROBABLYMISPLACED THE -- THE 1, AND,
UH --
(LAUGHTER)NATURALLY, SOME PEOPLE THINK
THAT WITH ALL THAT MONEYCHANGING HANDS --
(LAUGHTER)REALLY?
A LITTLE OLD REFERENCE, BUT ALLRIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)SOME PEOPLE THINK WITH ALL THE
MONEY CHANGING HANDS THEREMUST BE SOMETHING UNSEEMLY
GOING ON.
>> THAT'S THE WORLD IN WHICHPEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE
CLINTONS OR SOMEHOW BUYINGACCESS TO THE CLINTONS.
I MEAN, TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE,THE "NEW YORK TIMES" LAST YEAR
TOOK NOTE THAT CHELSEA CLINTONGETS ABOUT $75 OR AS MUCH AS
$75,000 A SPEECH FOR SPEAKING ONSUBJECTS LIKE DIARRHEA
WHICH IS A SUBJECT SHE SAYSSHE'S PASSIONATE ABOUT.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: IS IT YOUR SUGGESTION,
SIR, THAT AUDIENCES MIGHT NOT BEINTERESTED IN CHELSEA CLINTON'S
SPEECH ABOUT DIARRHEA?
(LAUGHTER)BECAUSE AS SHE HAS SO ELOQUENTLY
SAID -- SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'SFUNNY, BUT IT'S REALLY BROWN AND
RUNNY.
(LAUGHTER)CHA-CHA-CHA!
(APPLAUSE)ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY
THE Q&A SESSION AFTERWARDSTHAT'S MOST VALUABLE.
CHELSEA,CHELSEA CLINTON,JON STEWART AT "THE DAILY
SHOW," WHEN YOU'RE SLIDINGTO FIRST -- (LAUGHTER)
-- AND YOUR PANTS BEGIN TOBURST, IS THAT -- OH IT IS --
(LAUGHTER)I HAVE A QUICK FOLLOW UP!
-- WHEN IT SMELLS LIKE A FART,
MY POINT IS CHA-CHA-CHA!
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, DIARRHEAKILLS 1.5 MILLION CHILDREN EVERY
YEAR.
(LAUGHTER)ALL RIGHT.
UM...
SO -- SO THE OPTICS, THEDONATIONS FROM FOREIGN
GOVERNMENTS, THE OPTICS ARE NOTGOOD AND THERE'S A LOT OF
POTENTIAL FOR CORRUPTION.
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU KNOW, WHAT DOYOU CALL IT THERE, PROOF?
>> SO FAR THERE AREN'T ANYSPECIFIC CONCRETE EXAMPLES THAT
ANY COMPANIES OR FOREIGNGOVERNMENTS RECEIVED SPECIAL
TREATMENT -->> ABC FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT
HILLARY CLINTON TOOK ACTIONBASED ON THESE CONTRIBUTIONS.
>> Jon: WELL, THERE YOU HAVEIT.
NO PROOF, NO NOTHING.
THE ONE OPENING SANDERS MIGHTHAVE SHUT DOWN.
ALL FORMER SECRETARY CLINTON HASTO DO IS ADDRESS THIS SIMPLY AND
SQUARELY AND PUT THIS TO BED.
>> DID FOREIGN ENTITIES RECEIVEANY SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR MAKING
ANY KIND OF DONATIONS TO THEFOUNDATION OR YOUR HUSBAND?
>> Jon: I KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOINGTO SAY. I'M JUST GOING TO WRITE
DOWN MY ANSWER WHAT SHE'SGOING TO SAY
AND WE'LL SEE IF I'M RIGHT.
>> WELL, WE'RE BACK INTO THEPOLITICAL SEASON AND, THEREFORE,
WE WILL BE SUBJECTED TO ALLKINDS OF DISTRACTIONS AND
ATTACKS AND I'M READY FOR THAT.
IT IS, I THINK, WORTH NOTINGTHAT THE REPUBLICANS SEEM TO BE
TALKING ONLY ABOUT ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY TALKABOUT IF I WEREN'T IN THE RACE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S FUNNY, IWROTE DOWN "NO."
I WROTE DOWN "NO." SO THERE'SSTILL HOPE, BERNIE!
LET'S CHECK THE -- OH, DIDN'TMOVE AT ALL.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
