>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW"!
MY NAME IS ON STEWART! MY GUESTTONIGHT, WE' HAVE A GOOD ONE
FOR YOU, DREW BARRYMORE IS GONNABE JOINING US.
BUT LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT IN HONOROF FLEET WEEK, WE BEGIN
WITH THE DEPARTMENTOF VETERANS AFFAIRS
AND THE SEEMINGLY UNENDINGPROBLEMS IT IS PROVIDING
TIMELY MEDICAL CAREWITH SOME HOSPITALS GOING SO FAR
AS TO ACTIVELY COVER UP THISPROBLEM.
A SITUATION I THINK BEST SUMMEDUP THUSLY --
>> (BLEEP)!
>> Jon: THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.ALL RIGHT, BY THE WAY,
NO ONE IS MORE UPSETABOUT THIS THAN THE LIONS
OF THE REPUBLICANSENATE.
>> THE V.A. ISSUE IS A NATIONALEMBARRASSMENT AND THE
PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE TO IT IS ANEMAPARTMENT.
>> "TAKING CARE OF OUR VETERANSAND THEIR FAMILIES HAS BEEN ONE
OF THE CAUSES OF MY PRESIDENCY."WELL THEN YOU FAILED.
HE NEEDS TO TREAT THESESTORIES AT LEAST AS SERIOUSLY AS
HE DID THE OBAMACARE  WEB SITEFIASCO.
>> Jon: OH, HE TAKES THE V.A.,HE TURNS IT INTO OBAMACARE,
IF HE GRABS BENGHAZI, THETRIFECTA!
YES, THESE REPUBLICAN SENATORSHAVE ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR OUR
VETERANS!
WHEN THEY THINK IT CAN HELP THEMSLAM THE PRESIDENT.
IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WHENTHEY THINK NO ONE IS WATCHING.
>> A BILL THAT WOULD HAVEEXTENDED HEALTHCARE AND
EDUCATION FOR VETERANS GETTINGREJECTED IN THE SENATE, A
LACK OF SUPPORT FROM REPUBLICANSDOOMED THIS BILL.
>> Jon: WHAT? YOUMIGHT EVEN SAY THE LACK OF
SUPPORT OF THIS BILLFROM REPUBLICANS IS A
NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT. THATGETS EMBARRASSMENT-IER.
>> SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADERMITCH MCCONNELL TRIED TO ADD AN
UNRELATED POISON PILL AMENDMENTTO THAT VETERANS BILL THAT WOULD
IMPOSE NEW SANCTIONS ON IRAN.
>> Jon: I'LL JUST SLIP THIS --THIS POISON PILL IN THERE...
(LAUGHTER)IF ANYONE SAW IT, SURE WOULD
SEEM HYPOCRITICAL...
(LAUGHTER)THEN I'LL REWARD MYSELF WITH
A -- A CABBAGE LEAF.
(LAUGHTER)BUT, OF COURSE!
AS THE PRESIDENT'S CRITICSRIGHTLY POINTED OUT, PRESIDENT
OBAMA KNEW ABOUT THE V.A.
BACKLOG PROBLEMS BEFORE HE WASEVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> THIS MEMO PREPARED FORPRESIDENT ELECT OBAMA'S
TRANSITION TEAM BY THE GEORGE W.
BUSH ADMINISTRATION OUTLINED THEDIFFICULTIES VETERANS FACED IN
OBTAINING TIMELY HEALTHCARE.
>> Jon: PROVES TWO THINGS --ONE THIS, PRESIDENT HASN'T DONE
ENOUGH TO END THIS BACKLOG AND,TWO, THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT
HADN'T DONE ENOUGH TO END THEBACKLOG!
>>SO THE PROBLEMS EXISTED ONTHE DAY PRESIDENT BUSH LEFTOFFICE.
>> NO, NO, NO. NO. NO. NO ITDIDN'T. NO, NO, NO.
BY IMPROVING SYSTEMS, IT GOTDOWN TO AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT 161
DAYS BY THE TIME THAT BUSH LEFTOFFICE.
BY 2012, IT WAS BACK UP ABOVETHE 230 THAT WE INHERITED WHEN
WE CAME INTO OFFICE TO 260.
>> Jon: YEAH YOU GET THAT? EIGHTYEARS IN OFFICE AND HE'S
BRAGGING BECAUSE HE GOT THEVETERANS AVERAGE WAIT
DOWN TO FIVE OR SIX MONTHS,WHILE SOMEWHAT FORGETTING THAT A
GOOD REASON IT JUMPED BACK UP TOSEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS
WAS THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'SDOING AS WELL.
SO, I GUESS ROVE IS SAYING THEBUSH ERA V.A. WARNED THE
OBAMA TEAM NOT TO UNSOLVE THEPROBLEM THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION HADN'T SOLVEDEITHER.
THAT'S SO DISINGENUOUS EVEN BILL"BEYONCE-HUNTER" O'REILLY
CALLS BULL (BLEEP).
>> THE V.A. ITSELF MADE A REPORTTO THE INCOMING OBAMA PEOPLE.
>> NO, NO, NO. FIRST OF ALL, ITIS NOT A V.A. REPORT.
IT IS A REPORT FROM PEOPLEASSIGNED BY THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN
TO THEIR TRANSITION PLANNING.
THESE WERE PROBABLY DEMOCRATS INWASHINGTON.
>> YOU'RE WRONG.
THIS COMES FROM --
>> NO, NO HERE LET ME DESCRIBEWHAT IT IS. NO, NO, NO, LET ME
DESCRIBE WHAT THEPROBLEM WAS, BILL.
YOU ARE CONFLATING AGAIN.
>> I HAVE TO GO ON THE RECORD,MR. ROVE.
MR. ROVE, I HAVE TO GO ON THERECORD.
>> I KNOW, BUT LET ME FINISH,BILL.
>> NOPE.
>> SEE, THIS IS WHY I LIKEO'REILLY.
HE'S LIKE FOX NEWS' INCREDIBLEHULK.
SURE, HE'S USUALLY JUST AMINDLESSLY AGGRESSIVE FORCE OF
DESTRUCTION.
BUT POINTED IN THE RIGHTDIRECTION, HE BECOMES A HERO.
