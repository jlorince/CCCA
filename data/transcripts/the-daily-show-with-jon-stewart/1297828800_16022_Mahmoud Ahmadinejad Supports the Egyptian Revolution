RUINED THE INTERVIEW.
AS YOU KNOW, EGYPT'S
REVOLUTION, SO-CALLED FOR THE
BRAVE WOMAN WHO INSPIRED IT,
HAS TOUCHED OFF NOT ONLY AN
ENORMOUS RISE IN THE GLOBAL
DEMAND FOR JASMINE BUT AN
OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FOR THE
EGYPTIAN PEOPLE FROM AROUND
THE WORLD.
SOME OF THAT SUPPORT COMING
FROM UNUSUAL QUARTERS.
>> THE NATION OF EGYPT HAS THE
RIGHT TO BE FREE.
IT IS YOUR RIGHT TO PRACTICE
YOUR SOVEREIGNTY, ELECTING THE
TYPE OF GOVERNMENT, THE
ADMINISTRATION, THE RULERS.
>> Jon: HOLY... THAT IS
MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD STANDING
WITH EGYPT.
ON THE 32nd ANNIVERSARY OF
IRAN'S ISLAMIC REVOLUTION.
BY THE WAY IF YOU'RE THINKING
OF GETTING THEM SOMETHING I
BELIEVE THE 32nd ANNIVERSARY
IS THE ENRICHED URANIUM
ANNIVERSARY.
PERHAPS YOU CAN PICK SOME UP
AT MISLABELED CRATE AND
BARREL.
ANYWHO, AHMADINEJAD SUPPORTING
A FREE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO
EXPRESSION AND ASSEMBLY WHICH
IS GREAT NEWS.
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YESTERDAY
IRANIAN OPPOSITION GROUPS WERE
PLANNING A LARGE-SCALE
PEACEFUL PROTEST MUCH LIKE THE
ONES RICHLY PRAISED BY
AHMADINEJAD.
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN A
LOVEFEST.
>> IRANIAN SECURITY DETAILS
ARE OUT IN FORCE, FIRING TEAR
GAS AND BEATING PROTESTORS
WITH BATONS.
>> Jon: BATONS OF LOVE.
>> THEY'VE SHUT DOWN THE
INTERNET.
THEY'VE JAMMED FOREIGN
BROADCASTERS.
>> Jon: JAMMED THEM WITH LOVE.
>> IRANIAN LAWMAKERS WANT
OPPOSITION LEADERS TRIED AND
EXECUTED FOR ORGANIZING
PROTESTS.
>> Jon: TRIED AND EXECUTED
WITH (BEEP).
IT TURNS OUT THE IRANIAN
REGIME IS ONLY INTO FREEDOM
FOR EGYPTIANS.
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,
AHMADINEJAD, WITH THAT
ATTITUDE, I THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE A TOUGH TIME GETTING
RE-ELECTED.
REALLY THAT THIRD TERM IS NO
SLAM DUNK, SIR.
IRANIANS HAVE GOT TO BE
THINKING, WHAT DOES THAT
EGYPTIAN REVOLUTION HAVE THAT
WE DON'T HAVE?
YOU KNOW WHAT WORKED FOR THE
EGYPTIAN A STANDARD BEARER FOR
THE CAUSE.
THE EGYPTIANS HAD THAT
ARRESTED GOOGLE EXECUTIVE.
MAYBE YOU COULD GET THE
GOVERNMENT TO GRAB SOMEONE
FROM WHATEVER SEARCH ENGINE
IRANIANS ARE ALLOWED TO USE
LIKE, OH, YEAH, YAHOO-LULULULU.
LULULULULU.
DEPENDING ON HOW SHORT THE
SHOW WAS TONIGHT, THAT COULD
HAVE GONE ON FOR A WHILE.
ANYWAY, MACH MUD, IF YOU ARE
LISTENING-- AND I KNOW YOU
PROBABLY ARE.
I'M SURE YOU'LL STAY TUNED
AFTERWARDS.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST PRETEND
THAT EVERYONE IN YOUR COUNTRY
IS ACTUALLY EGYPTIAN, YOU KNOW,
THE PEOPLE YOU SEEM TO FEEL
