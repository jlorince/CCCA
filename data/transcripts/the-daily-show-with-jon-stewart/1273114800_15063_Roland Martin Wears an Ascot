( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT GOING ON IN THE NEWS THESE DAYS
IT'S OIL SPILL IN THE GULF,
DEVASTATING FLOODING IN THE SOUTH, AND OF COURSE THE BIG NEWS OUT OF TIMES SQUARE-- WE'RE
GETTING A NEW SHAKE SHACK.
( LAUGHTER ) AND SOMETHING ELSE.
BUT I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT A STORY THAT'S BEEN OVERLOOKED.
LAST WEEK DURING A DISCUSSION OVER ARIZONA'S CONTROVERSIAL NEW IMMIGRATION LAW ON CNN, WE SAW
THIS--
>> HE WASN'T SO CONVINCED THAT IMMIGRATION REFORM WAS ACTUALLY
GOING TO HELP DEMOCRATS IN THE LONG TERM WITH 10% UNEMPLOYMENT OUT THERE.
>> SANJAY, WILL YOU JUST GO AHEAD AND CALL IT LIKE IT?
>> Jon: THERE, RIGHT THERE!
LOOK, THERE IT IS!
ON NATIONAL TELEVISION, IN FRONT OF MILLIONS-- NO, CNN-- ( LAUGHTER )
IN FRONT OF SOME VIEWERS, CNN'S ROLAND MARTIN WORE AN ASCOT.
ON A NEWS PROGRAM.
A "NEWS-COT", IF YOU WILL.
THE ONLY EXPLANATION I CAN THINK OF OVER THE ASCOT, PERHAPS THEY INTERRUPTED ROLAND MARTIN WHILE
HE WAS HOSTING HIS OTHER SHOW.
IMMIGRATION IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE.
BUT NOT AS COMPLICATED AS THE NOTES OF PASSION FRUIT AND COFFEE IN EVERY GLASS OF EMREMY
MARTIN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN COGNAC.
THIS JUST IN-- YOU'RE DELICIOUS.
( LAUGHTER ) SERIOUSLY, AN ASCOT?
I MEAN, I LOVE THIS GUY.
HE'S A VERY SMART GUY.
HE'S FUN TO WATCH ON TELEVISION,
BUT IS THIS CNN'S BIG PLAN, TO COME BACK IN THE RATE SNGS GET A
TRUNK OF COSTUMES AND LET THEIR ANCHORS PLAY DRESS-UP?
I MEAN, I GUESS IT COULD WORK,.
I BET THEY'D TUNE IN TO CAPTAIN BIG BEARD.
OR RIDE THE RAILS.
WHICH BY THE WAY, IS STILL NOT AS HILARIOUS AS THE ASCOT.
( LAUGHTER ) NOT THAT I-- HONESTLY, NOT THAT I HAVE ANYTHING AGAINST ASCOTS.
LOTS OF FICTIONAL CHARACTERS WEAR THEM.
SHERLOCK HOLMES, THURSTON HOWELL III.
FRED FROM SCOOBY-DOO--
>> ACTUALLY, JON, THAT'S REALLY MORE OF A NECKERCHIEF.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
WHO--.
>> JON, MY DEAR BOY, FRIST FRIZ BEE-CATCHING DOGS WEAR NECKERCHIEFS.
MEN, THEY WEAR ASCOTS.
( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: THAT MAY BE THE LOUDEST BUBBLE PIPE IN HISTORY.
THAT HAS-- THIS MAY BE MY FAVORITE THING THAT I'VE EVER SEEN ON CNN.
I SWEAR TO GOD.
THAT IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH RICK SANCHEZ GETTING TASED.
THIS THING IS JUST... MMMWA.
I CAN ONLY PRAY SOME OF THE OTHER NETWORKS PICKED UP ON THIS COSTUME TREND.
>> HAVE YOU HEARD FROM JOHN STOSSEL'S INTERNS ABOUT HOW HE TREATS THEM?
>> I DON'T KNOW, I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.
>> I'M ARRESTING YOU, BECAUSE YOU'RE BREAKING THE RULES.
