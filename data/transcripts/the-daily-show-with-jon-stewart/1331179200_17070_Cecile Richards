>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, SHE IS THE
PRESIDENT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD
AND PRESIDENT OF PLANNED
PARENTHOOD ACTION FUND.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
CECILE RICHARDS.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
HOW ARE YOU?
>> FANTASTIC.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN
WATCHING THE NEWS RECENTLY.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: THERE IS A TREMENDOUS
DISCUSSION GOING ON IN THIS
COUNTRY RIGHT NOW ON WOMEN'S
HEALTH ISSUES, CONTRACEPTION,
MAINLY AMONGST I GUESS-YEAR-OLD
CALL THEM PENISSED AMERICANS.
SO WE THOUGHT WHY NOT BRING IN
SOMEONE WITHOUT A PENIS TO
DISCUSS HOW IT AFFECTS THE
PEOPLE THAT IT ACTUALLY ARE
BEING TALKED ABOUT.
>> THAT'S BIG OF YOU.
AND IT'S GREAT.
>> Jon: LET ME SAY THIS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
NO, HAS THAT BEEN ODD TO WATCH?
>> IT'S INCREDIBLE.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE TO
SEE NOW, WELL, FIRST THAT BIRTH
CONTROL ITSELF IS A TOPIC OF
POLITICAL DEBATE IN THIS
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
>> Jon: YOU MEAN RELIGIOUS
LIBERTY.
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, YEAH, I MEAN,
FOR WOMEN, OBVIOUSLY BIRTH
CONTROL IS NOT A RELIGIOUS
TOPIC, IT'S A HEALTH TOPIC, AND
99% OF WOMEN IN AMERICA USE IT.
AND AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD WE
PROVIDE BIRTH CONTROL TO
MILLIONS OF WOMEN EVERY YEAR.
SO I THINK THEY'RE MYSTIFIED BY
WHAT THE CONTROVERSY IS ALL
ABOUT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: ARE YOU... DOES THIS
PUT... WHAT IS THIS... DO YOU
FEAR THAT YOU'RE GOING BACK INTO
A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE
THE CONTRACEPTION CONVERSATION
ALL OVER AGAIN, THAT THAT WAS
BATTLE THAT WAS FOUGHT?
>> YOU WOULD THINK SO, AGAIN,
SINCE EVERYONE USES IT NOW, AND
ACTUALLY THE EXCITING THING IS
FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE THINK
WOMEN ACTUALLY WILL GET FINALLY
BIRTH CONTROL COVERED BY THEIR
INSURANCE PLANS, WHICH IS A
GREAT HEALTH... IT'S A GREAT
ADVANCE FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH.
IT'S A GREAT ECONOMIC ISSUE FOR
WOMEN, BUT IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL
PRIMARY, THIS SORT OF RACE TO
THE BOTTOM WHERE EVERY
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ON THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE IS TRYING THE
SAY, I WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY THE
WORST FOR WOMEN, INCLUDING BEING
OPPOSED TO BIRTH CONTROL
COVERAGE.
I THINK THE LAST TIME WE
ACTUALLY... THAT BIRTH CONTROL
WAS A CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC WAS
DURING PROHIBITION.
>> Jon: '60s AND '70s IT
WAS AN ISSUE.
ISN'T THAT WHEN GRISWOLD WAS
DECIDED?
>> YES, ACTUALLY FOR THE FIRST
TIME MARRIED COUPLES COULD USE
BIRTH CONTROL LEGALLY.
>> THE INTERESTING THING TO ME
IS HOW IT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO BE
AN ISSUE ABOUT WOMEN WANTING
SOMEONE TO PAY FOR THEM TO HAVE
SEX OR MONEY COMING OUT OF OTHER
PEOPLE'S POCKETS SO WOMEN CAN
HAVE SEX, IT STRIKES ME AS A
VERY INTERESTING DIRECTION TO
TAKE THE CONVERSATION.
>> IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY HARD
TO... I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I CAN
RESPOND TO THAT.
YEAH, YEAH.
>> Jon: I CAN.
I DID ON THE SHOW EARLIER.
>> AND THANKS FOR COVERING THIS
ISSUE.
FOR WOMEN, LOOK, AT PLANNED
PARENTHOOD, WE SEE ONE IN FIVE
WOMEN IN AMERICA AS SOME POINT
IN THEIR LIFETIME.
THIS LAST YEAR I THINK I'VE
HEARD FROM EVERY SINGLE ONE OF
THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE ASTOUNDED
WE'RE REDEBATING ISSUES THAT
HAVE BEEN SETTLED FOR A LONG
TIME.
>> Jon: THE CARICATURE OF
PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS THIS IDEA
OF AN ABORTION FACTORY WHERE THE
IDEA IS THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE YOUR
MONEY AND YOU'LL SET UP A
DRIVE-THROUGH AND THERE'S NO
THOUGHTFULNESS, THERE'S NO
MORALITY TO IT.
IT IS, YOU KNOW, THAT IS THE
TYPE OF EVIL PLACE THAT IT IS.
WHAT'S THE REALITY OF THE PLACE?
WHAT'S THE MANDATE?
-THE REALITY IS WE'RE THE
LARGEST FAMILY PROVIDEER IN THE
AMERICA AND WE DO MORE TO
PREVENT UNINTENDED PREGNANCY
THAN ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION IN
THIS COUNTRY.
>> Jon: WHAT WOULD BE
SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK MAYBE
YOUR CRITICS WOULD BE VERY
SURPRISED TO KNOW ABOUT.
>> MORE THAN 90% OF OUR SERVICES
ARE PREVENTATIVE CARE.
WE PROVIDE MORE THAN TWO MILLION
FOLKS WITH BIRTH CONTROL EACH
YEAR, BUT WE DO MORE THAN
750,000 PAP SMEARS EVERY YEAR,
BREAST EXAMS FOR WOMEN.
>> Jon: ON DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
NOT... OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULDN'T
BE RIGHT TO DO TO ONE PERSON.
>> NO, THAT'S RIGHT.
ACTUALLY, THE GREAT THING ABOUT
PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS WE'RE ALL
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND WHAT'S
FOR MANY WOMEN, WE ARE THEIR
ONLY MEDICAL PROVIDER.
WE ARE THEIR DOCTOR.
ON THE ONE DOCTOR VISIT THEY GET
A YEAR IS PLANNED PARENTHOOD.
THAT'S WHY THERE'S BEEN THIS
GROUNDSWELL OF CONCERN WHEN
POLITICIANS ARE SAYING WE'RE
GOING TO END NOT ONLY PLANNED
PARENTHOOD BUT ALL FAMILY
PLANNING IN AMERICA.
>> Jon: WHAT DO YOU THINK, IF
PLANNED PARENTHOOD WAS ONE OF
THOSE THINGS THAT WAS PUT TO A
VOTE IN AMERICA, I GET THE SENSE
THAT IT WOULD BE...
>> I THINK WE'D WIN.
>> Jon: IT WOULD BE A PRETTY
POPLAR PLACE IN LOCAL
COMMUNITIESEN IT SEEMS LIKE
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT BETTER THAN
ON THE NATIONAL STAGE.
>> ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, JON.
IN FACT, AS I SAID, ONE IN FIVE
WOMEN HAVE BEEN TO PLANNED
PARENTHOOD, SO THEY KNOW WHAT WE
DO.
NOT THAT I'M COMPETITIVE, BUT I
DID JUST SEE SOME NATIONAL
POLLING.
69% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT
ONLY SUPPORT PLANNED PARENTHOOD
BUT BELIEVE WE SHOULD GET PUBLIC
FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES
THAT WE DO.
CONGRESS APPROVAL RATING
HOVERING AROUND 10%.
SO IF IT REALLY CAME DOWN TO WHO
DO YOU THINK IS ON YOUR SIDE AS
A WOMAN AND FAMILY, I THINK
FOLKS WOULD VOTE FOR PLANNED
PARENTHOOD.
[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WHO WOULD YOU BE
RUNNING AGAINST AGAIN?
DO YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO
STICK AROUND?
WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE
WITH CECILE RICHARDS FROM
PLANNED PARENTHOOD.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
