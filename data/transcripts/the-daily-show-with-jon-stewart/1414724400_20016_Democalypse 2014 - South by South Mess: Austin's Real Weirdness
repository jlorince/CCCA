>> Jon: YOU KNOW, FROM WHATWE'VE SEEN IN OUR WEEK HERE.
AUSTINITES, YOU KNOW, THEY'REKEEPING IT -- OH, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT THE PHRASE IS --WEIRD?
(AUDIENCE REACTS)WEIRD, THAT'S IT.
BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,THERE IS
ONE THING ABOUT AUSTIN THAT WEFOUND TRULY BIZARRE.
SAMANTHA BEE REPORTS.
>> IF THERE'S ONE THING PEOPLEKNOW ABOUT AUSTIN, TEXAS, IT'S
WEIRD!
HOW DOES AUSTIN KEEP IT WEIRD?
>> OH, THEY HAVE A LOT OF REALLYCRAZY, KOOKY PEOPLE HERE.
>> OKAY.
LAST WEEK I SAW A GUY WITHA -- LIKE A BORE RAT KIND OF
THING JUST RIDING A BICYCLE.>> OKAY.
>> I WAS WALKING DOWN SIXTHSTREET ON LIKE A SATURDAY NIGHT
AND THERE WAS A WOMANABOUT NO TOP ON.
>> WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT AUSTIN?
YES, AUSTIN IS KNOWN AS THEFREE-THINKING, LEFT LEANING,
DISTINCTLY LIBERAL BLUEBERRY INTHE TOMATO SOUP OF TEXAS.
I COULD ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THEIRMEMBERS OF CONGRESS LOOK LIKE.
>> WHO'S YOUR CONGRESSIONALREPRESENTATIVE?
>> IT IS ROGER WILLIAMS.
ROGER WILLIAMS!
OH, MY GOD!
HE SOUNDS AMAZING!
WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE? IS HEJUST COVERED IN TATTOOS,
HE'S GOT, OH MY GOD, HE'SGOT LIKE THOSE PIERCINGS AND HE
SELLS DREAM CATCHERS AND -->> THAT'S NOT ROGER WILLIAMS AT
ALL.
>> HE PROBABLY HAS A DAUGHTERNAMED SUNBEAM OR WHATEVER.
AND HE TURNED HIS NAVEL INTOA STASH POCKET?
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.
>> HE'S AN OLD WHITE GUY.
HE'S A REPUBLICAN.
SO THERE YOU GO. THERE'S THAT.
>> WE HAVE FIVE REPUBLICANS THATREPRESENT AUSTIN IN CONGRESS.
>> FIVE REPUBLICANS REPRESENTAUSTIN IN CONGRESS OUT OF HOW
MANY?
>> OUT OF SIX.
OKAY, THERE GOES MY PROGRESSIVELADY BONER.
I'M TOTALLY FLACID NOW.
THEY'RE ONLY REPUBLICAN LIKEIRONICALLY, THOUGH, RIGHT?
>> NO, THEY LEGITIMATELY HAVETHE R IN FRONT AND THEY EMBODY
THAT R.
>> IN A CITY SO LIBERAL THAT THEONLY RIGHT-LEANING MAYORAL
CANDIDATE APPARENTLY RAN ON ABET, SOMEHOW FIVE OF SIX
CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVESARE STAUNCHLY REPUBLICAN.
MICHAEL MCCAUL VOTED TO DEFUNDPLANNED PARENTHOOD,
LAMAR SMITH CALLED THEDREAM ACT A NIGHTMARE.
ROGER WILLIAMS SAYS PRESIDENTOBAMA IS A SOCIALIST.
THIS GUY CO-SPONSORED THEBIRTHER BILL.
EVEN THE LONE DEMOCRAT LOOKSLIKE HE COULD FIRE YOUR FATHER.
IF ONLY THERE WERE AN EXPERT TOEXPLAIN EXACTLY HOW THIS
HAPPENED.
>> REDISTRICTING ORGERRYMANDERING IS WHEN THEY
REDRAW THE VOTING MAPS INORDER TO ENSURE A CONSTITUENCY
THAT WILL BRING THEM BACK TOOFFICE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT
POLITICIANS DO TO MANIPULATE THEVOTING PROCESS.
>> OH, THAT'S VERY GOOD.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
WOULD YOU LIKE A CRICKET?
THE REPUBLICAN-DRAWN MAPS WORKSSO HARD TO BREAK UP AUSTIN INTO
CONSERVATIVE FRIENDLY DISTRICTSTHAT THE 10th EXTENDS TO HOUSTON
WHILE THE 25th REACHES DALLAS214 MILES AWAY.
IN FACT, AUSTIN IS THE LARGESTCITY IN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT AN
ANCHOR DISTRICT.
AND THEN IT DAWNED ON ME, WHATMAKES AUSTIN WEIRD ISN'T THE TOP
HATS AND PENNY FARTHING BIKES,IT'S SOMETHING EVEN WEIRDER.
OH, MY GOD!
YOU AUSTINITES -- THAT'S WHAT'SSO WEIRD ABOUT AUSTIN, OKAY?
YOU SEEM TO BE SO PROGRESSIVEBUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF YOUR
CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVESARE STAUNCH REPUBLICANS.
YOU ALMOST HAD ME FOOLED INTOTHINKING IT'S TOTALLY
PROGRESSIVE HERE.
BUT IT'S -- I'M NEVER GOING TOBE COOL!
OH MY GOD, YOU GOT ME. YOU GUYSARE SO COOL!
YOU GUYS ARE SO COUNTERCULTURE!
I CAN'T EVEN KEEP UP.
>> THAT IS PRETTY WEIRD BUT NOTWEIRD IN THE WAY THAT I LIKE.
>> YES, EXACTLY!
REDISTRICTING WON'T TAKE PLACEHERE FOR ANOTHER EIGHT YEARS.
SO UNTIL THEN, AUSTINITES ARE(BLEEP) WITH REPRESENTATION THAT
DOESN'T REPRESENT THEM.
OH MY GOT, AUSTIN, KEEPING ITRED.
THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE DISTRICT21!
>> Jon: SAMANTHA, WE'LL BERIGHT BACK!
