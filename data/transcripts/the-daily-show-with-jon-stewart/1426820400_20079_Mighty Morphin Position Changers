>> Jon:  HEY, EVERYBODY,WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT,AN AMAZING SHOW.
YOUNG WILLIAM FERRELL WILL BEJOINING US ON THE PROGRAM
TONIGHT. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT FIRST, I TELL YOU, LADIESAND GENTLEMEN,
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN I LIKE TOCHECK IN WITH OUR GOOD FRIENDS
ON THE FOX NEWS NETWORK-- OR--OR AS YOUR GRANDPARENTS CALL IT
"THE REAL NEWS."
AND TO BE FRANK, OFTENTIMES THISSHOW IS CRITICAL OF FOX.
BUT ONLY BECAUSE THEY'RETERRIBLE.
( LAUGHTER )LIKE SOMETIMES ALMOST SHOCKINGLY
TERRIBLE.
FOR INSTANCE, TWO WEEKS AGO, THEJUSTICE DEPARTMENT RELEASED A
REPORT ON THE FERGUSON, MISSOURIPOLICE DEPARTMENT SHOOTING OF
MICHAEL BROWN.
BASICALLY EXONERATING OFFICERDARREN WILSON AND DEBUNKING THE
HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT,NARRATIVE.
AND THEN THEY RELEASED A SECONDD.O.J. REPORT STATING THAT THE
FERGUSON, MISSOURI ROUTINELYVIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION AND
FEDERAL LAW WITH A PATTERN OFRACIAL BIAS, UNREASONABLE FORCE,
INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION ANDMISTREATMENT OF DETAINEES
WRONGS BORNE DISPROPORTIONATELYBY AFRICAN AMERICANS.
BUT ON FOX-- YOU'RE GOING TOLOVE THIS-- DESPITE THEIR
24-HOUR SCHEDULE, THEY REALLYONLY HAD TIME FOR THE ONE
REPORT.
>> THE D.O.J. NOW ADMITTINGHANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT, NEVER
HAPPENED.
>> PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FED ANARRATIVE.
>> PROTESTERS WHO HAVE BEENRUNNING AROUND THIS COUNTRY
TELLING A LIE.
>> THE TSUNAMI OF MISINFORMATIONAND INNUENDO.
BONE-HEADED NONFACT-BASEDRHETORIC
>> IT NEVER HAPPENED.
>> DID NOT HAPPEN.
>> IT DID NOT HAPPEN THAT WAY.
WILSON HAS BEEN EXONERATED.
LET'S MOVE ON.
>> Jon:  LET'S MOVE ON!
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOUNDTHAT THE FLASHPOINT INCIDENT FOR
PROTESTS DID NOT HAPPEN THE WAYSOME THOUGHT.
ALTHOUGH, IN THE SECOND REPORT,THEY DID ALSO DOCUMENT A TOWER
OF RACIALLY BASED KINDLING WOOD,YEARS OF UNREASONABLE FORCE
LIGHTER FLUID, AND DAILY TOSSEDLIT CIGARETTE BUTTS OF
DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENTTHAT COULD EASILY LEND ITSELF TO
THE FLASHPOINT.
BUT AS THE FIRE SAFETY WARDENSOF FOX SUGGEST, ( BLEEP ) IT,
LET'S JUST MOVE ON.
( LAUGHTER )BUT HERE'S THE THING-- THE ANGER
IS STILL THERE.
THE PEOPLE COULDN'T MOVE ON ATFOX.
THEY-- THEY DEMANDED RESTITUTIONAT FOX.
>> WHY ISN'T THE MEDIA, WHICHPEDALED THAT NARRATIVE,
APOLOGIZING?
>> OBAMA, SHARPTON-- THEY SHOULDBE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR
INCENDIARY RHETORIC.
>> FANNING THE FLAMES, RUSHINGTO JUDGMENT.
>> BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS.
>> THE DAMAGE WAS DONE. THEINFLAMATORY RHETORIC WAS USED.
>> WE SAW MEMBERS OF CONGRESSSAYING, "HAND UP, DON'T SHOOT."
AND IF ONE OF THEM HAS SO FARAPOLOGIZED FOR MISLEADING
AMERICA, WE HAVEN'T HEARD IT.
>> Jon:  I HAVE NOT RECEIVEDA SINGLE "I'M BEAR-Y SORRY FOR
IGNITING RACIAL CONFLICTS"GREETING CARDS.
I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE!
THE LESSON FOX NEWS IS GETTINGAT IS VERY CLEAR-- WOULDN'T IT
BE NICE IF PEOPLE WHO JUMPED TOCONCLUSIONS AND PEDALED A FALSE
DIVISIVE, ANGER-STOKINGNARRATIVE HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR
MISLEADING AMERICA?
( LAUGHTER )( APPLAUSE )
NOW, NOW HERE'S WHERE THE( BLEEP ) GETS REAL.
I WONDER IF THERE'S AN ANALOGOUSEVENT WHERE WE COULD
TEST FOX'S FEALTY TO THISPRINCIPLE OF RESTITUTION
FOR AGGRIEVEMENT?
>> DOES THE WORD BENGHAZI RING ABELL?
>> A BUNCH OF NEW QUESTIONSABOUT BENGHAZI.
>> BENGHAZI.
>> BENGHAZI.
>> BENGHAZI, BENGHAZI, BENGHAZI.
>> Jon:  FIRST OF ALL,BENGHAZI ISN'T "BEATLEJUICE."
YOU DON'T SAY IT THREE TIMES.
BUT IF YOU INSIST, OKAY, LET'SUSE THAT EXAMPLE.
IT'S A TRAGIC EVENT WHEREAMERICANS DIED, LIKE FERGUSON.
BUT IF THE ANALOGY IS TO HOLD,WHO WILL PLAY THE ROLE OF
NATION-DIVIDING, ANGER-STOKING,RHETORITICIAN BEFORE THE
OFFICIAL GOVERNMENTINVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED?
>> SPECIAL REPORT INVESTIGATESDEATH AND DECEIT IN BENGHAZI.
>> SUSAN RICE WILLINGLY WENTALONG AND LIED ON SUNDAY CHAT
SHOWS.
>> THE C.I.A. WARNED THAT THEREMIGHT BE AN ATTACK ON THE 9/11
ANNIVERSARY.
>> DURING THE ATTACK, THEYDIDN'T SEND HELP THAT WAS
WAITING IN TRIPOLI, C-130, TOASSIST THESE GUYS.
>> COMING UP, THEY COULD HAVESAVED FOUR AMERICANS, BUT
INSTEAD, OUR GOVERNMENT TOLDTHEM TO STAND DOWN.
>> Jon:  SO BASICALLY YOU'RESAYING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
UNITED STATES TOLD ITSMILITARY-- IF I WANT TO PUT THIS
IN A CATCHY, PROTESTY KIND OFPHRASE-- STAND DOWN, DON'T
SHOOT.
AND FOX DIDN'T RESTRICT ITSANGER STOKING TO WORDS, BECAUSE
LET'S FACE IT, THEIR OLDERVIEWERS WHO ARE HEARD OF
HEARING, ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO BEMAD, SO SCARY OPENS AND
THAT BURNING BENGHAZI FOOTAGE INA SEMICONTINUOUS LOOP
LIKE SOME KIND OFFOX NEWS YULE LOG.
( LAUGHTER )OH, THEY'RE RUNNING THE BURNING
COMPOUND FOOTAGE AGAIN.
IT SEEMS LIKE BENGHAZ-MAS COMESEARLIER AND EARLIER EVERY YEAR.
BUT, OF COURSE, UNLIKE FERGUSONPROTESTERS, FOX WASN'T BEING
IRRESPONSIBLE AND DIVISIVE.
THEY JUST WANTED THE TRUTH.
>> WE HAVE UNANSWERED QUESTIONSABOUT BENGHAZI.
>> THERE ARE GLARING QUESTIONSTHAT ARE UNANSWERED.
>> QUESTIONS STILL REMAINUNANSWERED.
>> THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUTSTAND DOWN ORDERS AND SO ON, AND
HERE WE ARE ALL THE TIME LATER,WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS.
>> SO WE STILL DON'T HAVE THEANSWERS.
>> FOUR AMERICANS ARE DEAD, ANDTHERE ARE A LOT OF UNANSWERRED
QUESTIONS.
>> Jon: WELL, YOUR SENTENCECONSTRUCTION SAYS I JUST WANT TO
KNOW BUT YOUR TONE SAYS WHY THEPRESIDENT HAD AN AMBASSADOR
WHACKED.
WELL, FINALLY ON NOVEMBER 21,2014, THEY GOT THEIR ANSWERS
FROM AN EXHAUSTIVE REPORT FROMTHE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ANSWERINGTHOSE MANY QUESTIONS-- DID
SUSAN RICE GO ON TV AND TRY TODECEIVE ANYONE?
REPORT SAYS NO.
DID THE ADMINISTRATION IGNORECREDIBLE WARNINGS ABOUT THAT
DAY'S ATTACK?
REPORT SAYS NO.
WAS THERE A STAND-DOWN ORDER ORFAILURE TO RESCUE THOSE
INDIVIDUALS AND SEND RESCUEPLANES?
REPORT SAYS NO.
WAS THERE A MASSIVE INTELLIGENCEAGENCY COVER UP, THE REPORT SAYS
NO, NOT C.I.A., NOT F.B.I., NONEOF THEM.
WHICH MEANS ALL THESE ELEMENTSOF THE TWO YEAR BENGHAZI
RAGE-GASM -- WERE, WHATDO YOU, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?
>> TSUNAMI OF MISINFORMATION ANINNUENDO.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> BONE-HEADED, NON-FACTED-BASEDRHETORIC.
>> Jon:  YES! YES, YES, YES!THAT!
RIGHT, IT'S ALL THOSETHINGS.
SO IT WOULD ONLY FOLLOW THATJUST LIKE FOX DEMANDED OF ANY
PROTESTER WHO SAID, "HANDS UP,DON'T SHOOT," THE CORRECTION
ACTION FOR NO STAND DOWN DON'TSHOOT FOR FOX NEWS NOW
WOULD BE TO--
>> WHY ISN'T THE MEDIA WHICHPEDALED THAT NARRATIVE
APOLOGIZING?
>> Jon:  YES!
YES!
WHY NOT?
MWA!
OH ERIC, THAT'S SO TRUE.
YES!
AND SO, IN THE FATEFUL DAYSFOLLOWING THAT REPUBLICAN HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE REPORT,WHAT DID THE FOX SAY?
♪  ♪>> Jon:  YUNG-YUNG-YUNG!
IN FACT, OTHER THAN A COUPLE OFHALF-HEARTED EFFORTS TO
( BLEEP ) ON THE REPUBLICAN-LEDREPORT, ITS CONTENTS WENT
LARGELY UNNOTICED ON FOX.
EVEN MEGYN KELLY WHO WAS PRIORTO THAT DESPERATELY SEARCHING
FOR ANSWERS HAD THE HOUSECOMMITTEE CHAIR MIKE ROGERS ON
HER SHOW TWO WEEKS AFTER HERELEASED THE BENGHAZI REPORT AND
NEVER ASKED HIM ABOUT IT ONCE,NOT ( BLEEP ) ONCE.
YES, THE NETWORK, WHO USED THEWORD "BENGHAZI" LIKE A CLUBHOUSE
PASSWORD, THE OFFICIALREPUBLICAN-DOMINATED HOUSE
REPORT ON BENGHAZI WAS THE ONLYNEWS STORY IN TWO YEARS THAT
DIDN'T REMIND THEM TO TALK ABOUTBENGHAZI.
( LAUGHTER )WHICH BRINGS US, ONCE AGAIN, TO
OUR MAIN POINT OF RESPECT ANDAPPRECIATION.
THE BEAUTY THAT IS THE UGLINESSOF FOX NEWS.
THEY DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY FORANGER DIVISIVENESS, WHILST
HOLDING THEMSELVES ENTIRELYUNACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ANGER
AND DIVISIVENESS.
FOR TWO YEARS, THEY USEDBENGHAZI AS SHORTHAND, AS A
SYMBOL FOR THE WHOLE CONCEPT OFA CORRUPT, LYING, TYRANNICAL,
POSSIBLY MURDEROUS OBAMA WHITEHOUSE, KIND OF LIKE OTHER PEOPLE
USED "HANDS UP, DON'T SHOOT AS ASYMBOL FOR SYSTEMIC RACISM.
AND THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO
PHENOMENA-- SYSTEMIC RACISMACTUALLY EXISTS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
