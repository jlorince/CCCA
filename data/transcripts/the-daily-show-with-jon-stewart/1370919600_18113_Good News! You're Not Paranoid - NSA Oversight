THE QUESTION NOW IS CAN WE TRUST
THE PEOPLE WHO WE'VE TRUSTED
WITH OUR INFORMATION?
FORTUNATELY JUST THREE MONTHS
AGO THE SENATE HELD A HEARING
WITH DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE JAMES CLAPPER.
IN HINDSIGHT, HE GAVE US A TRULY
INTERESTING WINDOW INTO HIS
TRUSTWORTHINESS.
>> SO WHAT I WANTED TO SEE IF
YOU COULD GIVE ME A YES-OR-NO
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION: DOES THE
N.S.A. COLLECT ANY TYPE OF DATA
AT ALL ON MILLIONS OR HUNDREDS
OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS?
>> NO, SIR.
IT DOES NOT?
NOT WITTINGLY.
SPY SHOULD HAVE THAT BIG A
TAIL.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THE NORMANDY
LANDINGS ARE.
IS IT HOT IN HERE OR AM I JUST
LYING?
HERE'S HOW MUCH THIS GUY WAS
RUBBING HIS FOREHEAD.
THIS IS HIM AT THE START OF THE
HEARING.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS'
HAIR.
NOW THERE ARE SOME SYSTEMS
ALREADY IN PLACE, THANKFULLY, TO
PROTECT US FROM ALL OF THIS.
IT WOULD, FOR INSTANCE, BE
ILLEGAL FOR THE N.S.A. TO
DIRECTLY TARGET AMERICANS.
FOREIGNERS, HOWEVER, SURE.
FOR NATIONAL SECURITY THAT'S
FAIR GAME.
THE PROBLEM IS HOW CAN YOU TELL
ACCURATELY BETWEEN AN AMERICAN
AND A FOREIGNER?
I GUESS YOU COULD ASK, DO YOU
WANT TO WALK OR DRIVE?
BUT I'M SURE THAT THE N.S.A....
YOU DRIVE.
YOU KNOW YOU DRIVE.
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER THAT
AS A QUESTION.
BUT RELAX.
I'M SURE THE N.S.A. HAS A MORE
SCIENTIFICALLY PRECISE METHOD OF
DISCERNING BETWEEN THOSE TWO
OPTIONS THAN THAT.
>> ANALYST WHO USED THE SYSTEM
FOR A WEB PORTAL AT FORT MEED
KEY IN SCHRECKORS OR SEARCH
TERMS TO ARE DESIGNED TO PRODUCE
AT LEAST 51% CONFIDENCE IN A
TARGET'S FOREIGNNESS.
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
51%?
THAT IS A PRETTY [BLEEP] HUGE
MARGIN OF ERROR.
THAT'S BASICALLY FLIPPING A COIN
PLUS ONE PERCENT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
PLEASE!
TELL ME THAT WE HAVE RETAINED AT
LEAST AN EXTERNAL CHECK ON THE
N.S.A.
>> THE FISA COURT, THE
INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT,
HAS TO APPROVE ANY TIME N.S.A.
SEEKS TO PULL SPECIFIC
INFORMATION OUT OF THIS
DATABASE.
>> LAST YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, THE
GOVERNMENT ASKED THE COURT 1,789
TIMES FOR AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT
ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE.
THE COURT DID NOT DENY ANY OF
THE SURVEILLANCE REQUESTS.
>> SO THEY NEVER SAY NO.
IT'S BASICALLY AMERICAN IDOL
WITH FOUR RANDY JACKSONS.
WE'VE ESSENTIALLY GOT NOTHING TO
HOLD THE GOVERNMENT BACK
STRONGER THAN A RUBBER-STAMPED
COURT.
>> THERE ARE A WHOLE RANGE OF
SAFEGUARDS INVOLVED.
CONGRESS IS CONTINUALLY BRIEFED
ON HOW THESE ARE CONDUCTED.
>> THAT'S LOVELY.
SO NOW INSTEAD OF BEING SPIED ON
BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, IT
TURNS OUT WE'RE BEING SPIED ON
BY ALL THE BRANCHES.
I THINK YOU'RE MISUNDERSTANDING
THE PERCEIVED PROBLEM HERE,
MR. PRESIDENT.
NO ONE IS SAYING THAT YOU BROKE
ANY LAWS.
WE'RE JUST SAYING IT'S A LITTLE
BIT WEIRD THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
