(BEEP).
STILL, THE DAY AFTER THE
DEBATE, THERE WAS ONLY ONE
TOPIC ON ANYONE'S MIND.
IT WASN'T RON PAUL OR GINGRICH'S
SLAM ON MITT ROMNEY.
IT WAS THIS.
>> I READ YOUR FIRST BOOK.
IT SAID IN THERE THAT YOUR
MANDATE IN MASSACHUSETTS,
WHICH SHOULD BE THE MODEL FOR
THE COUNTRY.
I KNOW IT CAME OUT OF THE
REPRINT OF THE BOOK.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST SAYING
YOU REFER TO INDIVIDUAL
MANDATES, MY FRIEND.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'VE RAISED THAT BEFORE,
RICK.
>> IT WAS TRUE THEN.
IT IS TRUE NOW.
>> RICK, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
$10,000.
A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BET.
>> I'M NOT IN THE BETTING
BUSINESS.
>> OKAY.
>> Jon: THIS IS AWESOME.
A MORMON GAMBLING WITH AN
EVANGELICAL OVER WHO IS THE
BIGGER LIAR.
ARE THERE ANY COMMANDMENTS
LEFT?
WITH MORE ON ROMNEY'S $10,000
BET, WE TURN TO OUR SENIOR
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT JOHN
OLIVER IN IOWA.
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
WHY IS EVERYONE MAKING SUCH A
BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS $10,000
BET THING.
>> ONE, JON, BECAUSE IT FEEDS
INTO THE PRE-EXISTING
NARRATIVE ABOUT MITT ROMNEY
BEING AN OUT OF TOUCH
MULTI-MILLIONAIRE.
WHEN ROMNEY RAN THE BUY-OUT
FIRM, EVERYTHING ABOUT ROMNEY
TELLS THE TALE OF A MAN WHO
JUST FIRED YOUR DAD.
THIS IS NOT A NARRATIVE, JON,
THAT THE PRESS INVENTED.
LOOK AT HIS THIRD GRADE CLASS
PICTURE.
HIS HAIR IS EXACTLY THE SAME,
JON.
WHAT SEVEN-YEAR-OLD HAS
GRAYING TEMPLES?
>> Jon: WHAT ABOUT NEWT
GINGRICH?
HE HAS A PERSONAL NET WORTH
FROM LAST YEAR I THINK LIKE $6-
$7 MILLION.
A HALF A MILLION DOLLAR TAB AT
TIFFANY'S.
>> MONEY ISN'T GINGRICH'S
NARRATIVE.
IT'S THE INFIDELITY GUY.
HIS PROBLEM IS OATHS.
HE CAN FLAUNT HIS WEALTH ALL
HE LIKES.
WHAT HE CAN'T DO IS PROMISE TO
BE AMERICA'S PRESIDENT FOR
RICHER OR POORER AND
DEFINITELY NOT IN SICKNESS AND
IN HEALTH.
WITHOUT EVOKING IMAGES OF
PRESIDENT GINGRICH GETTING
BORED OF US AND MESSING AROUND
WITH A YOUNGER COUNTRY BEHIND
OUR BACK.
>> Jon: SO GINGRICH IS SAYING
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
EVERY CANDIDATE HAS AN ACHILLE'S
HEEL, THAT SPOT WHEN THEY WERE
DIPPED INTO INDESTRUCT I
BELIEVE CAMPAIGN JUICE WAS
LEFT UNCOVERED LEAVING THEM
VULNERABLE.
>> Jon: I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY
ACHILLY'S MOM DIDN'T DIP HIM
TWICE MAKING SURE SHE COVERED
THE HEEL.
>> YOU CAN'T DOUBLE DIP, JON.
IT'S RUDE TO THE PEOPLE
WAITING IN LINE BEHIND YOU.
>> Jon: JUST ONE DIP AND A
LITTLE LADLE.
I MEAN THE WHOLE THING IS
DONE.
IT'S NOT A SECOND DIP.
I'M JUST SAYING....
>> THAT'S TWO DIPS, JON.
>> Jon: IT'S AN EASY DIP.
>> YOU'RE BONKERS, PLEASE.
>> Jon: WHAT'S RICK PERRY'S
ACHILLY'S HEEL?
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.
>> Jon: YOU JUST SAID
EVERY....
>> RICK PERRY HAS AN ACHILLE'S
HEAD.
>> THE IDEA THAT THIS
PRESIDENT NOW WITH IRAN
GETTING ONE OF OUR PREDATOR
DRONES IN THEIR POSSESSION AND
HE HAD TWO OPPORTUNITIES OR HE
DIDN'T HAVE TWO OPPORTUNITIES,
HE HAD TWO CHOICES, ACTUALLY
HE HAD THREE.
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING, PERRY?
YOU KNOW THAT LISTING THINGS
IN THREEs IS OFF LIMITS TO
YOU.
NUMBER IN ANY FORM REALLY.
IF YOU HAVE TO LIST STUFF, DO
IT WITH LETTERS.
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR
NARRATIVE THEN?
>> YOU DON'T, JON.
YOU EMBRACE IT.
UNFORTUNATELY ROMNEY IS NO
GOOD AT THAT.
>> THIS WAS AN OUTRAGEOUS
NUMBER TO ANSWER, AN
OUTRAGEOUS CHARGE FROM HIM.
IT'S BEEN PROVEN WRONG TIME
AND TIME AGAIN.
I SAID OKAY LET'S PUT
SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS OUT.
IT'S LIKE SAYING, HEY, I'LL
BET YOU A MILLION BUCKS.
>> EXCEPT HE DIDN'T SAY A
MILLION BUCKS, DID HE?
HE SAID $10,000.
IF HE HAD SAID A MILLION BUCKS
HE STILL HAS 200 OF THOSE.
THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THIS,
JON.
IF HE REALLY WANTS TO SHAKE
RICK PERRY UP, HE HAS TO
EMBRACE THE RICH DOUCHE
WITHIN.
>> Jon: HOW?
HOW DOES ONE DO THAT?
>> JUST LOOK RICK PERRY IN THE
EYE AND SAY, "HEY, RICK, YOU
KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO TO
YOU?
I'M GOING TO BUY UP ALL THE
LAND AROUND YOUR FAMILY'S
HOUSE AND THEN BUILD FACTORIES
THAT LEAK ETHER INTO YOUR
WATER SUPPLY.
SURE, THE EPA WILL FIGHT IT,
RICK, BUT I'LL HIRE SO MANY
LAWYERS THAT THEY'LL BE FORCED
TO GIVE UP THE CASE OR GO
BANKRUPT.
AND THEN I'LL WALK INTO YOUR
POISONED HOUSE IN FRONT OF
YOUR CHOKING FAMILY WHO CAN'T
GET UP TO HELP US BECAUSE
THEIR GENES ARE NOW MUTATING,
THEIR LEGS CAN'T SUPPORT THEIR
WEIGHT AND I WILL STRANGLE YOU
TO DEATH.
WHY WILL I DO THIS?
BECAUSE I'M RICH, RICK.
AND THIS IS THE KIND OF (BEEP)
THAT RICH PEOPLE CAN DO."
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: EMBRACE IT?
>> YEAH.
AND THEN MITT ROMNEY'S GOT TO
LOOK STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA
AND SAY TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE, "VOTE FOR ME.
YOU HAVE NO (BEEP) IDEA WHAT
I'M CAPABLE OF."
>> Jon: JOHN OLIVER,
EVERYBODY.
WE'LL
