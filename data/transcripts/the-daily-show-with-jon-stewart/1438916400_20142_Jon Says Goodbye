>> Jon:  ALL RIGHT,EVERYBODY. THAT IS OUR PROGRAM.
NOW, THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE TOTHANK THAT I CANNOT PLAUSIBLY DO
IT IN THE AMOUNT OF TIMEALLOTTED.
COMEDY CENTRAL GAVE ME THISOPPORTUNITY 16 AND A HALF YEARS
AGO.
THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED HEREGAVE ME THE TALENT AND
INSPIRATION TO DEVELOP IT OVERALL THOSE YEARS.
IT'S THE MOST INCREDIBLE PLACE.
HONESTLY, TODAY, IT STILL FEELSLIKE A DREAM A LITTLE BIT, AND
WALKING AROUND THE BUILDINGTODAY, NOBODY WAS MAKING EYE
CONTACT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'SSO MUCH LOVE AND PRIDE FILLING
THE BUILDING RIGHT NOW, THAT WEJUST DON'T WANT TO DROWN IT IN
SALINE.
SO THERE'S A LOT OF THIS-- "SOTHE SCRIPT IS READY?"
"UH-HUH."
SO EVERYBODY IS MAKING MOVESWITH SALTY GOGGLES ON.
SO I JUST CAN'T THANK THEPEOPLE WHO WORK HERE ENOUGH, AND
I CAN'T THANK COMEDY CENTRALENOUGH AND I CAN'T THANK THE
AUDIENCE ENOUGH.
YOUR SUPPORT AND ENTHUSIASM OVERTHE YEARS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )HAS BROUGHT TO US-- DON'T--
DON'T THINK THAT THE ENERGY THATYOU PUT OUT IS NOT RECEIVED ON
THOSE DAYS WHERE WE JUST FEELLIKE WE DON'T HAVE IT.
>> WE LOVE YOU!
>> Jon:  I'M VERY FOND OFYOU AS WELL, SIR.
IT SEEMED AWFULLY GRAVELLY.
( LAUGHTER )I WANT TO THANK MY WIFE, TRACY,
AND MY KIDS, NATE AND MAGGIE.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )NOT GOING TO LOOK OVER THERE.
FOR TEACHING ME WHAT JOY LOOKSLIKE.
AND... AN ARTIST I REALLY ADMIREONCE SAID HE THINKS OF HIS
CAREER AS A LONG CONVERSATIONWITH THE AUDIENCE, A DIALOGUE.
AND I REALLY LIKE THAT METAPHORFOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS BUT
THE MAIN ONE IS BECAUSE IT TAKESAWAY THE IDEA OF FINALITY.
THIS IS JUST-- IT'S ACONVERSATION.
THIS SHOW ISN'T ENDING.
WE'RE MERELY TAKING A SMALLPAUSE IN THE CONVERSATION, A
CONVERSATION, WHICH, BY THE WAY,I HAVE HOGGED AND I APOLOGIZE
FOR THAT.
( APPLAUSE )I NEVER-- I REALLY-- I SHOULD
HAVE AT SOME POINT TURNED THECAMERA AROUND AND SAID, "DO YOU
GUYS HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD?"I'VE REALLY BEEN DOMINATING THIS
IN A VERY SELFISH WAY.
BUT I THOUGHT THAT WAS AREMARKABLE WAY OF GETTING TO
THAT. NOTHING ENDS.
IT'S JUST A CONTINUATION.
IT'S A PAUSE IN THECONVERSATION.
SO RATHER THAN SAYING GOOD-BYEOR GOODNIGHT, I'M JUST GOING TO
SAY, "I'M GOING TO GO GET ADRINK,
AND I'M SURE I'LL SEE YOU GUYSBEFORE I LEAVE."
