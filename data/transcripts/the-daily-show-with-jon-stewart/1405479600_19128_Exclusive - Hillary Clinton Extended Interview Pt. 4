>> Jon: DO YOU BELIEVE,THOUGH, THAT THE ISRAELI
LEADERSHIP, NETANYAHU, TRULY ARESINCERE?
YOU KNOW, THE SETTLEMENTBUILDING CONTINUES NO MATTER
WHAT AMERICA OR THE RESTOF THE WORLD SAYS.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Jon: DOESN'T THAT SEND AMESSAGE THAT IT'S NOT A REAL
SINCERITY ON THEIR PART, ANDHASN'T HE EVEN TALKED
RECENTLY ABOUT A ONE-STATESOLUTION BEING THE ONLY OPTION?
SO AREN'T BOTH OF THESE PEOPLESTRAPPED BY THEIR LEADERSHIPS AND
THE MORE WE GET INTO WHO ISWORSE, WHO IS BETTER, THE LESS
WE'RE LIKELY TO FIND SOME SORTOF SOLUTION.
>> WELL, THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T GOAT IT LIKE THAT.
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP YOUR EYE ONTRYING TO PERSUADE BOTH SIDES.
AND WHEN I SAY "BOTH SIDES," IREALLY MEAN THE ISRAELI
LEADERSHIP AND THE PALESTINIANAUTHORITY LEADERSHIP BECAUSE
AS I SAY, HAMAS HAS REJECTED THEINTERNATIONAL STANDARDS BY WHICH
THEY COULD BE PART OF SUCH ANEGOTIATION.
THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU CAN GET TODEFINING BORDERS, AND OUR
POLICY EVER SINCE MY HUSBANDWAS PRESIDENT, REITERATED BY
BUSH, REITERATED BY PRESIDENTOBAMA...
>> YOUR HUSBAND WAS PRESIDENT?[LAUGHTER]
>> YES. HE WAS. YEAH, YEAH.
HE WORKED IN ONE OF THOSE ROOMSWITHOUT CORNERS.
>> Jon: YOU THOUGHT TOYOURSELF, I COULD GET USED TO
THAT. >> WELL, NOT AT THE TIME.
>> Jon: NOT AT THE TIME.
>> BUT SINCE THEN I'VE GIVEN ITSOME THOUGHT. SO, I THINK WHAT
HE...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: YOU'RE RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.
YOU'RE RUNNING.
>> WHAT HE TRIED TO DO AT CAMPDAVID AND WHAT PRESIDENT BUSH
TRIED TO DO WITH SOMETHINGCALLED THE ROAD MAP AND WHAT
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SECRETARYKERRY AND I BEFORE THEM TRIED TO
DO WAS TO COME TO AN AGREEMENTTHAT WOULD OUTLINE BORDERS AND
THEN SOME SETTLEMENTS WOULD BEIN THE BORDERS.
OTHERS WOULD NOT BE.
I MEAN, THAT WAS THE WHOLETHEORY.
AND ON BOTH SIDES, I REALLYTHINK IT'S NOT SO MUCH
CALCULATION OR RESISTANCE.
IT'S INSECURITY AND FEAR.
>> Jon: WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEMSUSTAINABLE.
>> WELL, I AGREE WITH THAT. IAGREE WITH THAT.
>> AND IT SEEMS LIKE BOTHLEADERSHIPS ARE GETTING
SOMETHING OUT OF THISCONFLICT CONTINUING,
OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T.
>> WELL, BUT I THINK IF THEYWERE BOTH HERE AND I HAD, I
WRITE ABOUT THIS, I HAD,I MONITORED AND PARTICIPATED
IN THE LAST LEADER-TO-LEADERMEETINGS.
WE HAD THREE SUCH MEETINGS WHEREWE REALLY NEGOTIATED.
IT WAS JUST FOUR OF US IN THEROOM.
IT WAS NETANYAHU.
IT WAS ABBAS.
IT WAS ME AND GEORGE MITCHELL,WHO WAS OUR SPECIAL ENVOY.
>> Jon: HE WAS REPRESENTINGHAMAS?
>> YEAH, NO HE WASN'T, BUT HEWAS, HE WAS A VERY GOOD
NEGOTIATOR...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SOMEBODY WHO HAD WORKED ONTHE IRISH PEACE PROCESS.
IN FACT, HE TELLS A FUNNY STORYABOUT HOW HE WAS IN JERUSALEM
TALKING ABOUT HIS WORK ON THEIRISH PEACE PROCESS WITH MY
HUSBAND, AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW,THIS WAS A VERY LONG CONFLICT,
IT WENT BACK 800 YEARS AND ITTOOK A LONG TIME AND A LOT OF
EFFORT TO GET THE PARTIES TOTRUST EACH OTHER ENOUGH TO MAKE
A NEGOTIATION THAT LED TO PEACEAGREEMENT.
800 YEARS.
ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN THEAUDIENCE SAID, I THINK IT WAS A
HEBREW UNIVERSITY SAID, "SUCH ARECENT CONFLICT."
I MEAN, REALLY, YOU KNOW.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO, YEAH, HISTORY IS AHEAVYWEIGHT.
AND, THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MINDTHAT BOTH SIDES, AND I'VE SEEN
IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN,THEY EACH KNOW WHAT AN
AGREEMENT SHOULD LOOK LIKE.
AND I REMEMBER WHEN EHUD BARAKWAS PRIME MINISTER.
HE MADE A VERY EXTENSIVE OFFERTO YASSER ARAFAT.
AND, I THINK WHAT HAPPENED ISARAFAT JUST BASICALLY SAID,
I AM AFRAID TO TAKE IT. IDON'T KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT.
I'M COMFORTABLE IN THE ROLE THATI'M IN, WHICH IS A KIND OF
GUERRILLA-TURNED, YOUKNOW, POLITICIAN, BUT I DON'T
KNOW THAT I CAN BE A LEADER, AGOVERNMENT LEADER.
EVERYBODY LIVES WITH THEIR OWNFEARS AND INSECURITIES, AND
WHAT'S SO TRAGIC ABOUT THEROCKETS COMING FROM GAZA AFTER A
PERIOD OF, YOU KNOW, TWO-PLUSYEARS BECAUSE OF THE CEASEFIRE I
WAS INVOLVED IN, IS NOWEVERYBODY'S BACK IN
THEIR CORNERS AGAIN.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND UNLESS WE CAN GIVE PEOPLEENOUGH OF A SENSE OF SECURITY ON
BOTH SIDES THAT THEY'RE GOING TOBE BETTER OFF AND THEIR CHILDREN
ARE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF, THENTHE GUYS WITH THE GUNS CAN
ALWAYS DISRUPT ANYTHING.IT'S WHY AN EXTREMIST IN ISRAEL
KILLED, YOU KNOW, YITZHAK RABIN.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE HE KNEW YITZHAKRABIN COULD MAKE LASTING PEACE.
AND THERE ARE EXTREMISTS ON ALLSIDES. AND PEOPLE WITH GUNS ON
ALL SIDES. AND SO LEADERSHIPHAS TO BE VERY TOUGH-MINDED
AND VERY STRONG, BUT THEY HAVETO HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT TOO
MAKE THE HARD CHOICES.
>> Jon: WHAT? YOU DID NOT DOTHAT.
WHAT?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]WOW.
HONESTLY, THAT MAY BE... LET MEGO TO THE JUDGES ON THAT.
WHAT... THAT MAY BE THEGREATEST SEGUE IN THE HISTORY
BACK TO... THAT MAY BE THEGREATEST SEGUE BACK TO A TITLE.
THANK GOD YOU GO TO "HARDCHOICES" AND NOT "STUFF I DID."
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU.
>> HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
