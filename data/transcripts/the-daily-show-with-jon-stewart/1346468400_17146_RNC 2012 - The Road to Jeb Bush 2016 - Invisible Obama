DID IN EIGHT YEARS.
AND THAT'S WHY CLINT EASTWOOD COMES IN.
AND THAT IS WHERE CLINT EASTWOOD HAS DONE A HUGE FAVOR TO US ALL.
BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S IRRATIONALITY THAT THEY HAVE WORKED SO HARD AT
THE CONVENTION TRYING TO CONCEAL WAS UNLEASHED IN A 12 MINUTE IMPROVISED AVANT-GARDE PERFORMANCE OF
ONE ANGRY MEN.
EASTWOOD FINALLY REVEALED THE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE THAT IS THE BEATING HEART
AND SOUL AND FICTION OF THIS PARTY.
HE'S SO FAR GONE THEY ARE HAMMERING OBAMA FOR THINGS BUSH DID.
AND ROMNEY IS.
>> BUT YOU THOUGHT THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN WAS-- WAS OKAY, I MEAN YOU THOUGHT
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS WORTH DOING.
WE DIDN'T CHECK CHECK WITH THE RUSSIANS TO SEE HOW THEY DID THERE FOR THE TEN YEARS,
BUT-- .
>> Jon: OH, SNAP.
YOU REALLY GAVE IT TO THE GUY WHO DIDN'T GET US INTO THAT WAR.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA FOR ATTORNEYS TO BE PRESIDENT ANYWAY.
>> Jon: YEAH, TAKE THAT HARVARD LAUER BARACK OBAMA,
YOU'LL NEVER BE THE MAN HARVARD LAWYER MITT ROMNEY IS.
SO WE-- WE OH CLINT EASTWOOD A DEBT OF THANKS.
NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS A TRULY HILARIOUS 12 MINUTES OF IMPROVISED AWESOME IN A
WEEK OF SCRIPTED BLAH, BUT BECAUSE IT ADVANCED OUR UNDERSTANDING.
THIS PRESIDENT HAS ISSUES AND THERE ARE VERY LEGITIMATE DEBATES TO BE HAD ABOUT HIS POLICIES AND
ACTIONS AND SUCCESSES AND OR FAILURES AS PRESIDENT.
I MEAN TUNE IN NEXT WEEK.
(LAUGHTER) BUT COY NEVER WRAP MY HEAD AROUND WHY THE WORLD AND THE PRESIDENT, THAT REPUBLICANS
DESCRIBE BEARS SO LITTLE RESEMBLANCE TO THE WORLD AND THE PRESIDENT THAT I EXPERIENCE.
AND NOW I KNOW WHY.
THERE IS A PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT ONLY REPUBLICANS CAN SEE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) AND WHILE THE PRESIDENT, THE REST OF US SEE HAS ISSUES,
APPARENTLY THIS PRESIDENT,
INVISIBLE TO MANY, IS BENT ON OUR WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION.
BUT LOOK, INVISIBLE OBAMA IS GREAT FOR MY BUSINESS.
I'M STILL SAD TRUMP'S NOT RUNNING.
(LAUGHTER) BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE THIS ELECTION ABOUT THIS GUY?
LET ME SEE IF I CAN PARAPHRASE.
GO AHEAD, MAKE MY DAY.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
