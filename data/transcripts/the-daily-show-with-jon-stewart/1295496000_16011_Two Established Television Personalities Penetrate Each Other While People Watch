TAKING OUR JOBS WE'RE APPARENTLY
SENDING OUR JOBS DIRECTLY TO
THEM.
I TURN ON THE TV THIS MORNING
AND CAUGHT THE "TODAY" SHOW,
GLENN BECK MAKING AN APPEARANCE
TO PROMOTE HIS NEW BOOK AND
THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE THAT
CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.
>> THIS IS WHERE THE CRITICS
COME UP INTO PLAY SAYING YOU
ADDED INTO THIS DIALOGUE OF
HATRED.
THE PRESIDENT IS A RACIST.
YOU SAID JOKINGAND YOU WANTED TO
POISON NANCY PELOSI.
YOU WANTED TO BEAT CONGRESSMAN
CHARLIE RANGEL TO DEATH WITH A
SHOVEL.
IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS BOOK, DO
YOU REGRET THAT STUFF NOW?
>> ANYTHING I SAID IN JOKES, NO.
ASK JON STEWART.
ASK "THE SIMPSONS."
>> Jon:  HUH?
I THINK GLENN BECK THINKS I'M A
CARTOON CHARACTER
( LAUGHTER )
GLENN, HERE'S THE THING, MY
MAN-- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL
MEREDITH VIERA TO ASK ME.
ASK ME YOURSELF.
( LAUGHTER )
ONCE AGAIN, MY BROTHER.
YOU, MY FRIEND, AND I-- HOLD ON.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
I THOUGHT WE WERE CHANGING THAT
TITLE.
( LAUGHTER )
I'M JUST--
( APPLAUSE )
BUT MY MESSAGE-- MY MESSAGE IS
THE SAME-- GLENN BECK, I WOULD
LIKE YOU TO BE ON OUR SHOW, BY
WHICH I MEAN APPEAR ON MY SHOW,
SO YOU CAN GET IS THIS THINGS
OFF YOUR CHEST.

TO--
( APPLAUSE )
I'D LIKE TO-- JUST LOSE THE
LOWER 30.
I'LL SWEETEN THE DEAL, BROTHER
MAN.
I'VE GOT A PRESENT FOR YOU.
I LOVE YOU LOVE THE TEACHIN.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S ONE OF THEM FIVE-PRONGED
COLORED CHALK THINGS.
YOU COULD USE IT ON YOUR BOARD
TO DO ALL THE STUFF YOU DO.
IMAGINE, YOU COULD GET FIVE
PEOPLE CONNECTED TO GEORGE
SOROSE.
( LAUGHTER )
TELL ME IF YOU'LL COME UP
BECAUSE I DO HAVE TO GIVE THIS
BACK TO MY DAUGHTER.
SERIOUSLY, I'LL ASK YOU SOME
QUESTIONS.
