(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOUTONIGHT.
PUT IT TOGETHER JUST A LITTLEWHILE AGO.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, FAREEDZAKARIA, AUTHOR OF "IN DEFENSE
OF A LIBERAL EDUCATION," INTERMS OF HUMANITIES, ET CETERA,
ET CETERA, AND SO FORTH.
LAST WEEK...
(LAUGHTER)OH, (BLEEP) JUST GOT REAL.
LAST WEEK, THE OBAMAADMINISTRATION AND IRAN IN
COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA, FRANCE,BRITAIN, GERMANY AND CHINA,
REACHED AN HISTORICOUTLINE OF A FRAMEWORK
OF AN OUTLINE OF APOTENTIAL DRAFT FOR A PRE-FINAL
TENTATIVE NUCLEAR DEALARRANGEMENT!
PENDING APPROVAL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BUT FIRST, CONGRESS HAS SOME
CONCERNS.
>> THIS DEAL DOESN'T DISMANTLEONE CENTRIFUGE, IT DOESN'T CLOSE
ONE SITE.
>> NO ONE TRUSTS IRAN.
>> I DON'T TRUST THE LEADERSHIPOF IRAN.
>> THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACLEAR RECOGNITION ON THEIR PART
THAT ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TOEXIST AS A JEWISH STATE.
>> I WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED THESENEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN WITH.
>> Jon: WHAT!
SO I GUESS WE'RE GIVING CEDINGTO LIARS AND ANTI-SEMITES IN A
NEGOTIATION THAT NEVERSHOULD HAVE EXISTED BUT
OTHER THAN THAT,GOOD FIRST DRAFT.
WHAT COURSE OF ACTION IF NOT ATREATY WOULD CONGRESS RECOMMEND?
>> SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OFWHAT PRESIDENT CLINTON DID IN
DECEMBER 1998, SEVERAL DAYS OFAIR AND NAVAL BOMBING
AGAINST IRAQ'S WEAPONS OF MASSDESTRUCTION FACILITIES.
>> Jon: OH, RIGHT!
1998, CLINTON SENT MISSILES INTHERE IN OPERATION I GUESS
THAT'S THAT.
(LAUGHTER)YEAH, THAT 1998 BOMBING FIXED
IRAQ FOREVER, TRANSITIONING THATCOUNTRY FROM A DICTATORSHIP
TO AN AMERICAN-LOVINGKITTEN-AND-FUDGE-BASED
DEMOCRACY.
EVERYONE LOVES AKITTEN-AND-FUDGE-BASED
--DEMOCRACY. BUT THE TRUTHIS, EVEN IF THE SENATORS --
(LAUGHTER)
REALLY? HONESTLY, JUST ADDED A[BLEEP] T. THAT'S ALL WE DID.
EVEN IF THE SENATORS DID THINKTHE DEAL WITH IRAN WAS A GOOD
DEAL, THE SENATORS WOULD STILLHAVE TO FULFILL THEIR
CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION.
>> NO SENATE OR HOUSE SHOULDEVER LET ANY PRESIDENT DO AWAY
WITH CONGRESSIONAL SANCTIONSCREATED BY THE BODIES WITHOUT
THEIR APPROVAL.
>> I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT ISSENATE APPROVE THIS LIKE WE
DO ANY TREATY.
>> IT REQUIRES THE ADVICE ANDCONSENT OF THE UNITED STATES
SENATE.
>> Jon: SLOW DOWN THERE, McCAIN!
SENATE'S ALREADY IN SESSION,LIKE, THREE DAYS A MONTH!
(LAUGHTER)YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERLOAD YOUR
SCHEDULE, BLOW A GASKET.
OF COURSE!
THE CONSTITUTION ALSO GIVESCONGRESS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO
DECLARE WAR.
HOW CONCERNED ARE THEY WITHDEFENDING THAT AUTHORITY FROM
PRESIDENTIAL OVERREACH?
>> I DON'T WANT TO LIMIT OURCOMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
>> THIS RESOLUTION SAYS WIN AWAR, IT TAKES GROUND TROOPS
WHEREVER IT TAKES.
>> A GUY NAMED RONALD REAGANINVADED A SOVEREIGN, SMALL
SOVEREIGN NATION CALLEDGRENADA, YOU KNOW, AND NOTIFIED
EVERYBODY THE NEXT MORNINGAFTER, AFTER IT WAS COMPLETED.
>> CONGRESS SHOULD SORT OF SHUTUP.
>> Jon: THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TOFOCUS, EVERYBODY!
HE'S BOMBING PEOPLE!
MY ADVICE IS THAT CONGRESSCONSENT TO A HOT CUP OF SHUT
THE (BLEEP) UP!
DELAWARE!
DELAWARE!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)DELAWARE, WHEN THE PRESIDENT'S
BOMBING PEOPLE, YOU SO MUCH SAYA WORD I WILL SHOVE YOU SO FAR
UP MASSACHUSETTS' ASS, YOU WILLSMELL MAINE!
(LAUGHTER)
A LOT OF THE TOUGH TALK FROM --
AS A MATTER OF FACT, CONGRESS ISSO LAX IN THEIR WAR-MAKING
OVERSIGHT, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELFIS SOMEWHAT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH
THE AMOUNT OF FIRE IN HIS POWERLIKE HIS DRONE STRIKE AUTHORITY.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE GOTTO DO IS PUT A LEGAL
ARCHITECTURE IN PLACE AND WENEED CONGRESSIONAL HELP TO DO
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLYAM I REINED IN BUT ANY PRESIDENT
IS IN TERMS OF SOME OF THEDECISIONS WE'RE MAKING.
>> Jon: STOP ME CONGRESSBEFORE I KILL -- OH, TOO LATE.
TURNS OUT, WHEN IT COMES TOBOMBING COUNTRIES OR SENDING
ADVISORS TO COUNTRIES OR DRONESTRIKING COUNTRIES, CONGRESS IS
THE GIRL WHO JUST CAN'T SAY NO.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO COOPERATINGWITH COUNTRIES, TREATIES -- HOLD
ON THERE!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MISTER?
LIKE THE SMALL ARMS TREATY TOSTOP THE ILLEGAL INTERNATIONAL
TRADE OF ARMS RATIFIED BY 66OTHER COUNTRIES.
>> WHY IN THE WORLD WOULDSOMEBODY WANT TO GIVE TO CEDE
TO THE UNITED NATIONS OR ANYMULTI-NATIONAL GROUP THE POWER
TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS AS TOWHOM, WITH WHOM WE TRADE ARMS.
>> THIS TREATY WILL INFRINGE ONTHE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF
AMERICAN GUN OWNERS.
>> Jon: BLACK MARKET SOMALIARMS TRAFFICKING DOESN'T KILL
PEOPLE.
PEOPLE WHO BUY BLACK MARKETSOMALI ARMS -- OH, FORGET IT!
(LAUGHTER)OR THE LAW OF THE SEA TREATY
WHICH CREATES GUIDELINES FOR HOWCOUNTRIES CAN RESPONSIBLY USE
MARINE NATURAL RESOURCES,RATIFIED BY 167 COUNTRIES OR
IT'S KNOWN, EARTH MINUS US.
>> WHAT IT DOES IN JUST A ONESENTENCE FORM IS TO RELINQUISH
OUR SOVEREIGNTY OVER 70% OF THEWORLD.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE WE THESPANISH ARMADA?
AS YOU KNOW, AMERICA CURRENTLYOWNS THE OCEANS.
EVER SINCE PRESIDENT NIXON BLEWON NEPTUNE'S FABLED CONCH SHELL
AND BECAME PRINCE OF THE DEEP!
(LAUGHTER)OR -- AND THE ONE IS HONESTLY
HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WE WON'TRATIFY, THE TREATY TO PROMOTE
RIGHTS FOR THE DISABLEDRATIFIED BY 153 NATIONS.
>> IN ALL HONESTY, I DON'T WANTTO LOSE OUR SOVEREIGNTY IN THIS
ISSUE.
>> Jon: OH! I DON'T WANT SOMEONE WORLD BLACK HELICOPTER
ILLUMINATI COMING HERE ANDTELLING US WHICH RAMP NEEDS
TO GO IN FRONT OF WHICH LIBRARY!
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT WE'REALWAYS WORKING AGAINST OTHER
COUNTRIES, WE DO WORK WITH OTHERCOUNTRIES, WE DO IT ALL THE
TIME.
>> WELL, CERTAINLY WE NEED OTHERPARTNERS.
I MEAN, WE NEED THESE OTHER ARABCOUNTRIES TO STEP IN.
>> THE UNITED STATES MUST BECOMMITTED TO BUILDING A
COALITION THAT ASSISTS THEIRAQI, KURDISH AND FREE SYRIAN
FORCES.
>> DEMONSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TOTHE GLOBAL COALITION IN
DEFEATING THIS RADICAL ISLAMICORGANIZATION.
>> AMERICAN SOLDIERS NEED TO GOBACK TO SYRIA AND IRAQ AS PART
OF THE COALITION -->> Jon: SEE?
YOU WANT TO WORK WITH THE UNITEDSTATES, HUH?
WELL, THERE'S ONLY TWO THINGSYOU CAN DO WITH RAMPS -- BUILD
'EM OR BOMB 'EM.
(LAUGHTER)AND I DON'T SEE NO BUILDING RAMP
MATERIALS.
(LAUGHTER)WHICH BRINGS US TO THE QUESTION,
WHY ARE WE SO (BLEEP) CAUTIOUSAND UNWILLING TO COOPERATE WITH
THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY ONNON-MILITARY AGREEMENTS?
>> WHENEVER A BILL OR A TREATYIS PASSED, THERE ARE SOME
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
>> LET'S DO IT WITHOUT ENMESHINGOUR NATION INTO ANOTHER BINDING
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION THATWILL CAUSE MORE GRIEF THAN
BENEFIT.
>> YOU ALSO NEED TO PAY VERYCAREFUL ATTENTION TO THOSE
CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE UNINTENDEDBECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE DANGER
TRULY LIES.
>> Jon: YES, THE UNINTENDEDCONSEQUENCES OF TRYING TO MAKE
PEACE!
OUR CONGRESS IS INCREDIBLYCAUTIOUS ABOUT TREATIES BECAUSE
YOU NEVER KNOW THE BLOW-BACKPEACEFUL COOPERATION CAN HAVE!
WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME!
MAYBE IF WE HADN'T BEEN SOEAGER TO COLLECT HALLOWEEN
PENNIES FOR UNICEF, IRAQ WOULDBE A STABLE COUNTRY TODAY.
AND I.S.I.S. WOULD NEVER GET AFOOTHOLD.
BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF GOODNESSBAKED INTO OUR CONSTITUTION, TO
MAKE PEACE, TWO-THIRDS OF THESENATE NEED TO COME ALONG.
YOU WANT TO GO TO WAR, THOUGH?
SIMPLE MAJORITY.
AND A QUICK TIP IF YOU CALL ITSOMETHING ELSE, YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER THE (BLEEP) YOU WANT.
WE'RE THE EDWARD SCISSORHANDS OFCOUNTRIES.
WE WANT TO LOVE BUT WE ONLY KNOWHOW TO HURT!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
