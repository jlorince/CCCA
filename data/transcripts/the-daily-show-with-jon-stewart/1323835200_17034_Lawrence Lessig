>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE DIRECTOR
OF THE EDMUND J. SAFRA
FOUNDATION CENTER FOR ETHICS AT
HARVARD UNIVERSITY.
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD ONE OF
THOSE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND A PROFESSOR AT HARVARD LAW
SCHOOL.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED
"REPUBLICAN LOST: HOW MONEY
CORRUPTS CONGRESS AND A PLAN TO
STOP IT."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
LAWRENCE LESSIG.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
>> GREAT TO BE HERE.
>> Jon: "REPUBLIC LOST."
SIR, IF YOU WERE TO REMOVE MONEY
FROM CONGRESS AND ITS CORRUPTING
INFLUENCE, DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO GET MORE
INVOLVED?
BECAUSE... I'M NOT SO SO SURE WE
WOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK SOME OF YOU... OKAY,
MAYBE NOT YOU BUT SOME OF THEM
WOULD, SURE.
THEY HAVE TO GET MORE INVOLVED.
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A
SYSTEM FOR FUNDING WHERE .05% OF
AMERICANS MAX OUT IN THE
CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN.
.26% GIVE MORE THAN $200.
SO CAMPAIGNS ARE FUNDED BY THE
TINIEST SLICE OF AMERICANS.
>> Jon: NOT EVEN THE TOP 1%.
>> NO, SO THE OCCUPY WALL STREET
PEOPLE ARE SO PROUD OF THEY'RE
"WE'RE THE 99%"?
BAD MARKETING.
WE'RE THE 99.95% WHO DOESN'T
HAVE ACCESS THE WAY THE .05% HAS
ACCESS BECAUSE THEY FUND THE
CAMPAIGN.
>> Jon: NOW YOU TALK ABOUT
MONEY DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN
INFLUENCE BUT IT DOES MEAN
ACCESS.
>> YEAH, IT MEANS ACCESS BUT THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING IT MEANS IS
THAT THIS IS THE THING THE
CONGRESSMEN ARE OBSESSING ABOUT
ALL THE TIME.
THEY SPEND 30% TO 70% OF THEIR
TIME RAISING MONEY WHICH MEANS
THEY'RE CONSTANTLY FOCUSED ON
SHAPE SHIFTING TO GET THE MONEY
AND TO AVOID DOING THINGS THAT
MIGHT DRIVE THE MONEY AWAY.
SO IT'S NOT SURPRISE WHEN THEY
LIVE IN THIS LIFE THEY BECOME
DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDERS AS
OPPOSED TO THE PEOPLE AND THAT
IS THE CORRUPTION.
THEY ARE DEPENDENT UPON INSOMNIA
NOT AS THE FRAMERS SAID THE
PEOPLE ALONE BUT ON THE FUNDERS.
>> Jon: IT'S NOT JUST THE
DISTRACTION OF THEIR TIME BUT
THE DISTORTION OF THEIR TIME AND
THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS.
>> RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING
TO BE RESPONDING TO THIS TINY
SLICE OF AMERICA WHICH THEY DO
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND, SURPRISE,
SURPRISE, THAT LEAVES THE REST
OF AMERICANS TO BELIEVE THAT
MONEY BUYS RESULTS IN CONGRESS.
THREE QUARTERS OF AMERICANS
BELIEVE MONEY BUYS RESULTS IN
CONGRESS.
>> Jon: ONE OF THE CRAZY
THINGS THAT WAS IN THERE IS THIS
IDEA THAT CONGRESS REGULATES
BUSINESS, IT'S A WEIRD SYMBIOTIC
RELATIONSHIP.
THEY DON'T WANT TO DEREGULATE IN
SOME MEASURE BECAUSE THEN THEY
LOSE THEIR FUNDING.
>> SO THE LIBERTARIANS ARE KEEN
ON GETTING A SMALL GOVERNMENT.
I'M NOT INTO THAT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE.
I RESPECT IT.
BUT THE POINT IS YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO GET A SMALL GOVERNMENT
OR SIMPLER TAXES AS LONG AS
CONGRESSMEN DEPEND UPON HAVING A
BIG GOVERNMENT AND COMPLEX TAXES
SO THEY HAVE SOMEONE TO CALL TO
RAISE MONEY.
SO YOU'VE GOT A SPECIAL TAX
BENEFIT, YOUR TAX BENEFIT IS
ABOUT TO EXPIRE, CONGRESSMAN
HAGS HAS TO BE-TO-CALL TO SAY
"WE WE'LL NEED SUPPORT IF WE GET
THIS BENEFIT EXTENDED."
SO THE POINT IS TO SEE THE WAY
MONEY LINKS EVERY ISSUE WE CARE
ABOUT ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT.
OBVIOUSLY ISSUES ON THE LEFT
HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY MONEY IN
THIS ADMINISTRATION.
PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT HAVE TO
RECOGNIZE, TOO, THAT MONEY
BLOCKS THEIR ABILITY TO GET WHAT
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.
THERE'S ONLY ONE SACRED TAX IN
THIS BOOK AND THAT'S HENRY DAVID
THOREAU.
FOR EVERY THOUSAND STRIKE
HACKING AT THE BRANCHES OF EVIL,
THERE'S ONE STRIKING AT THE
ROOTS.
THE POINT IS, THIS IS THE ROOT.
THE MONEY IS THE ROOT AND UNLESS
WE FIND ROOT STRIKERS WHO ARE
WILLING TO STRIKE AT THAT ROOT
WE'LL NEVER FIX THE PROBLEM.
>> Jon: CAN WE COME UP WITH...
(APPLAUSE).
I THINK A PROBLEM OF THIS
MAGNITUDE AND A PROBLEM OF THIS
FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY, IS
THERE ANY WAY WE CAN COME UP
WITH SOMETHING MAYBE SEXIER THAN
ROOT-STRIKER?
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE FOR PEOPLE
TO FIGHT THIS THEY'RE GOING TO
WANT TO SOUND A LITTLE MORE
HEROIC.
ROOT STRIKER IS A LITTLE ROUGH.
HOW ABOUT THIS?
BATMAN.
>> BATMAN, OKAY.
>> Jon: LOOKING TO THE LOOKING
GLASS, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU
HAVE THIS SENSE OF... AND I VIEW
IT THIS WAY AS WELL, THAT THE
MONEY COMING INTO THE GOVERNMENT
CORRUPTS THEIR IDEAL OR CORRUPTS
THEIR LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES BUT
IN SOME RESPECTS YOU'RE ALSO
SAYING BUT FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S
PERSPECTIVE IF YOU REMOVE THAT
MONEY IT CORRUPT THEIRS ABILITY
TO BLACKMAIL.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: SO IT RAPT IT IS
EXTORTION.
SO ON THE ONCE SENSE THIS SIDE
IS TRYING TO INFLUENCE
LEGISLATION AND ON THIS SIDE
THEY'RE TRYING TO EXTORT MONEY.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THAT EXTORTION DYNAMIC IS THE
MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE WAY
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS DEAL WITH
BUSINESSES INSIDE OF GOVERNMENT
SO THEY CALL THEM UP AND SAY
"I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THIS
PARTICULAR ISSUE YOU'VE GOT.
OH, BY THE WAY, WE HAVE THIS
FUND-RAISER."
AND THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR.
JACK ABRAM MOF'S BOOK IS FAN TAS
NICK MAKING THIS TRANSPARENT.
PERFECTLY CLEAR.
IF YOU DON'T PLAY BALL BY
PARTICIPATING IN THE
FUND-RAISING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GET ACCESS OR YOUR PARTICULAR
ISSUE PUSHED INSIDE OF CONGRESS.
>> Jon: AND THERE'S NO WAY FOR
YOU TO MAKE THE CASE ABOUT HOW
IN ANY ISSUE THE INDUSTRY HAS
VASTLY MORE RESOURCES THAN THE
PEOPLE.
>> YEAH, WHEN WE DID QUOTE
FINANCIAL REFORM-- YOU REMEMBER
THAT, RIGHT?
>> Jon: I DO REMEMBER THAT.
FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS.
>> IN OCTOBER OF THAT YEAR THERE
WERE 25 TIMES THE NUMBER OF
LOBBYISTS ON CAPITOL HILL
FIGHTING REFORM AS THERE WERE
LOBBYISTS PUSHING FOR REFORM.
AND SO IT'S NOT SURPRISE WE GOT
ONLY "FINANCIAL REFORM" NO
ACTUAL FINANCIAL REFORM OF WALL
STREET AT ALL.
>> Jon: SO HERE'S WHAT WE DO.
DO YOU HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO
STICK AROUND?
YOU HAVE SOME INTERESTING IDEAS
ABOUT FIXING IT AND WE'LL...
THIS WILL GO ON THE INTERNET SO
THE PEOPLE WHO ONLY HAVE T.V.s
WILL WATCH IT AND GO "OH MY GOD,
WE'RE (BLEEP)ED."
(LAUGHTER)
BUT IF THEY WERE TO STAY AND
WATCH IT ON THE INTERNET THEY
WOULD GO "OH, MY GOD, WE'RE
SAVED!"
"REPUBLIC LOST" IS ON THE
BOOKSHELVES NOW.
