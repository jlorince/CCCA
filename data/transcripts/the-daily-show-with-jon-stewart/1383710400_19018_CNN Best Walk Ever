OCCASIONALLY FRUSTRATING, LIKEWHEN THERE'S
A BREAKING NEWS INCIDENT THEYFAN OUT IN THE STREETS AND

YEARS MAKING BP AMERICA'SLARGEST ENERGY INVESTOR.
OUR COMMITMENT HAS NEVER BEENSTRONGER.
>> Jon:  WHAT JUST HAPPENED.
THEY CAME BACK FROM COMMERCIALTO A COMMERCIAL COVERING WHAT
THEY COULD HAVE DONE DURING THECOMMERCIAL.
AND THE CHERRY ON TOP.
THE COMPANY THAT IS SPONSORINGTHIS NEWS SEGMENT IS ACTUALLY IN
THE NEWS QUITE A BIT. MOSTLY FORSTORIES
ABOUT HOW HARD THEY'VE BEENWORKING TO GET GULF COAST
AQUATIC BIRDS OUT OF THEIROIL.
THE COUCH WALK IS SO GLORIOUSLYUNNECESSARY I THINK I'M IN LOVE
WITH IT.
THEY'RE BANGING THEM OUT LEFTAND RIGHT.
SOMETIMES THEY WALK TOTHE COUCH ON JUST A WHIM.
>> YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION BRAINFOOD? IT TURNS OUT THERE'S
SOMETHING TO IT.

LIKE IT'S A COUCHABLECONVERSATION.

TO HEAR IT OR CAN I --I -- LET ME
SAY SOMETHING TO THE HEADS OFCNN, PEOPLE WHO RUN CNN.
DON'T MAKE THESE PEOPLE DO THAT.
