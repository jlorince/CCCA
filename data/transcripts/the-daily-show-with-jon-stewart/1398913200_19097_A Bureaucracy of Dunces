MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE GOT A GOOD ONE FOR YOU
TONIGHT. TONIGHT'S GUESTS, OHYOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY THIS.
MARTIN GILENs AND BENJAMIN PAGETHEY ARE THE
AUTHORS OF A NEW ACADEMIC STUDYTESTING THEORIES OF AMERICAN
POLITICS, ELITES, INTERESTGROUPS AND AVERAGE CITIZENS.
IF YOU READ BUT ONEEMPIRICALLY BASED,
POST-SURVEY QUANTITIVEMULTIVARIED ANALYSIS OF --
[LAUGHTER]YOU SHOULD, AH (bleep) IT, LET'S
JUST TALK ABOUT NET NEUTRALITY.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT FIRST, THOSE OF US WHO WHILE
WATCHING CONGRESS CONTINUE TO BEUNABLE TO BRING EVEN AN INCREASE
IN THE MINIMUM WAGE TO A FLOATSTILL BELIEVE IN GOVERNMENT'S
ABILITY TO EARN PEOPLE'S TRUST.
THIS NEXT SEGMENT, PROBABLY NOTFOR YOU.
[LAUGHTER]A PERFORMANCE REVIEW WE CALL
U.S. GOVERNMENT, YOU MUST CHECKYOURSELF VIS A VIS YOUR ETHICAL
OR OTHERWISE COMPETENCY-BASEDPERFORMANCE ISSUES
PURSUANT TO THE REQUISITEFEDERAL BYLAWS AND
POPULAR INTERESTS, ORIT BECOMES ENTIRELY
POSSIBLE THAT YOU MAY WRECKYOURSELF.
BEFORE THEY BEGIN THE REVIEW LETME JUST GET OUT MY CLIPBOARD AND
MY (bleep) PENCIL.
[ LAUGHTER ][LAUGHTER]
[LAUGHTER](bleep).
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S BEGIN.
IT'S REALLY JUST A PROP.
WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE INTERNALREVENUE SERVICE.
IRS IF YOU ARE NASTY.
FIRST, SOME GOOD NEWS.
REMEMBER WHEN WE SUSPECTED THEIRS OF UNFAIRLY TARGETING
CONSERVATIVE GROUPS.
TURNS OUT THEY WERE ALSOTARGETING PROGRESSIVE GROUPS, SO
OOPS.
KEEP UP THE TARGETING. ALTHOUGH,
THERE'S ONE AREA WHERE THE IRSMIGHT WANT TO IMPROVE.
>> A REPORTED 1% OF THE IRS WORKFORCE OWES BACK TAXES TO THE
IRS.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: IT'S LIKE RAIN ON YOUR
WEDDING -- IT'S A FREE RIDE WHENYOU ON -- DON'T LIKE RIDES.
[ LAUGHTER ]BY THE WAY YOU WERE SAYING, THE
PEOPLE AT THE PAY US YOUR TAXESPLACE DON'T PAY THEIR TAXES.
>> IT'S QUITE LOW WHEN YOUCONSIDER THAT 8% OF THE GENERAL
PUBLIC OWES BACK TAXES TO THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: AH YES, BUT IT'S QUITE
HIGH WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNTIT'S THE IRS.
IT'S LIKE SAYING WELL ONLY 1% OFTHE WORKERS AT THE CENTERS FOR
DISEASE CONTROL ARE SPREADINGDISEASE.
[ LAUGHTER ]MOST OF THEM ARE NOT OPENING
VIALS OF SMALL POX ON CROWDEDSUBWAYS AT ALL.
I GUESS THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THISPROBLEM IS TO HIRE ANOTHER IRS
PERHAPS TO POLICE THEM.
AN IIRS.
PERHAPS WE NEED AN IIIRS AND ANIVRS.
[ LAUGHTER ]PRETTY SOON WE'RE ALL JUST PART
OF A NESTING DOLL OF OVERSIGHT,PARANOIA AND SUSPICIOUS, EACH OF
US INVESTIGATING THE NEXT TOINFINITY UNTIL IT TURNS OUTWE'VE
REALLY JUST BEEN INVESTIGATINGOURSELVES THE WHOLE TIME.
â™ª [LAUGHTER]
AND MAYBE THEN WE REALIZE RIGHTAND WRONG ARE JUST TWO SIDES OF
THE SAME COIN WE CALL THEUNIVERSE OR DID I JUST BLOW YOURMIND?
[LAUGHTER]YEAH, PROBABLY NOT.
YOU KNOW, CAN I ALWAYS DO THAT,BY THE WAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]ALWAYS A CAMERA WITH A
PSYCHEDELIC BACKGROUND.
