>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE
GUEST.
FROM THE GREAT GATSBY ACTRESS
CAREC MULLIGAN IS JOINING US.
I HEARD THE MOVIE IS GREAT, SO
GREAT THAT THEY'RE THINKING OF
MAKING THE MOVIE INTO A BOOK.
LET'S GET TO THE TOP STORY
TONIGHT.
TESTAMENT FROM GOVERNMENT
WHISTLE BLOWERS ON THE
DEVASTATING AND TRAGIC ATTACK
THAT CAUSED FOUR AMERICAN LIVES
IN BENGHAZI LIBYA, TESTIMONY
THAT WILL BLOW THE LID OFF THE
GIANT COVER-UP PROPAGATED BY
THIS ADMINISTRATION.
>> BRACE YOURSELF.
IT'S HAPPENING IN JUST
NINE-AND-A-HALF HOURS FORMER
C.I.A. DIRECTOR DAVID PETRAEUS
WILL TAKE THE OATH AND TESTIFY
ABOUT BENGHAZI.
>> Jon: I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS A SNAFU.
THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE WARNING TO
BRACE YOURSELF FOR NOVEMBER'S
BENGHAZI TESTIMONY BY DAVID
PETRAEUS.
THAT WAS GOING TO BLOW THE LID
OFF THE GIANT COVER-UP
PROPAGATED BY THIS
ADMINISTRATION.
MY MISTAKE.
ALL RIGHT.
TODAY'S HEARING WAS THE HEARING
MOMENT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN
WAITING FOR.
>> WE BEGIN WITH THE MOMENT THAT
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN WAITING FOR.
SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY
CLINTON'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED
TESTIMONY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN
BENGHAZI.
>> Jon: I APOLOGIZE ONCE MORE.
THAT WAS FROM THE JANUARY
BENGHAZI HEARINGS.
THAT ALSO FAILED TO BLOW THE LID
OFF THE GIANT COVER-UP
PROPAGATED BY THIS
ADMINISTRATION.
TODAY, WEDNESDAY.
>> COME WEDNESDAY YOU'RE GOING
TO START HEARING THE TRUTH ABOUT
BENGHAZI.
IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU MAD.
IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU UPSET.
>> Jon: AND IF IT DOESN'T, WE'VE
HAVE ANOTHER ONE UNTIL IT DOES.
YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHY FOR
BENGHAZI CONGRESS HAS HELD NINE
FULL HEARINGS.
INCLUDING ONE CLOSED HEARING.
WHY AMBASSADOR PICKERRING AND
ADMIRAL MULLENNISH EYED A FULL
ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT CHASTISING
THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR
SYSTEMIC FAILURES AND WHY
BENGHAZI IS GENERALLY EMERGED AS
A RALLYING CRY FOR THE
PRESIDENT'S OPPONENTS.
WHEN DURING THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, THERE WERE 54
ATTACKS ON DIPLOMATIC TARGETS
THAT KILLED 13 AMERICANS YET
GARNERED ONLY THREE HEARINGS ON
EMBASSY SECURITY TOTAL AND ZERO
OUTRAGE FROM FOX.
WHY IS THIS ATTACK SO DIFFERENT
FOR REPUBLICANS?
>> THIS MAKES WATERGATE LOOK
LIKE CHILD'S PLAY, MEGAN.
>> Jon: OH!
WELL, THAT IS SERIOUS.
THAT IS SERIOUS AND IT'S NOT A
TERM PEOPLE THROW AROUND
LIGHTLY.
I'M SORRY.
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SLIND RA.
I'M SORRY.
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SLIND RA.
ANYBODY TALKING ABOUT BENGHAZI.
>> THIS IS FAR WORSE THAN
WATERGATE.
>> Jon: FAR WORSE THAN
WATERGATE.
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
BENGHAZI IS... SORRY ABOUT THAT.
HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE
FAST-AND-FURIOUS.
THE MOVIES BECAUSE I DIDN'T CARE
FOR TOKYO DRIFT BUT I DON'T
THINK IT... ALL RIGHT.
THE THING WITH THE GUNS AND THE
TRACING OF THEM.
IF FAST-AND-FURIOUS WAS WORSE
THAN WATERGATE WHAT'S BENGHAZI.
>> IF YOU HAD WATERGATE AND
IRAN-CONTRA TOGETHER AND
MULTIPLY IT BY TEN OR SO YOU'LL
GET IN THE ZONE OF WHAT BENGHAZI
IS.
>> Jon: HOLY [BLEEP].
WATERGATE PLUS IRAN-CONTRA TIMES
TIMES... YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE
INCIDENT WHEREBY ORDER OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
PEOPLE BROKE INTO THE DEMOCRATIC
HEADQUARTERS TO BUG IT TO GAIN
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IN A
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THEN
COVERED THAT UP BY TRYING TO USE
THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY TO
SQUASH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
AND THEN ADDED THAT TO THE
REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S SECRET
DEAL TO ILLEGALLY SELL ARMS TO
IRAN IN EXCHANGE FOR HOSTAGES
AND MONEY THAT COULD THEN BE
FUNNELED TO CENTRAL AMERICAN
RIGHT WING DEATH SQUADS, END
PARENTHESES, TIMES TEN?
I'M IN.
I'M IN.
HOW COULD IT NOT
