>> Jon: WELCOME BACK TO THESHOW.
NOW, PEOPLE ARE ALWAYSCOMPLAINING.
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS COMPLAININGTHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
IGNORES SO-CALLED CLIMATE CHANGESCIENCE, BUT THERE IS A REASON
WHY THEY REFUSE TO LISTEN TOALARMISTS.
>> GLOBAL WARMING IS A TOTALFRAUD.
>> A DOG AND PONY SHOW FOR THEIRLIBERAL DONORS.
>> THE PRESIDENT CONTINUESPURSUING THIS GLOBAL WARMING
AGENDA.
>> IT'S REALLY A HOAX.
>> Jon: A HOAX!
IT'S LIKE WAR OF THE WORLDS IFTHERE HAD BEEN OVERWHELMING
EVIDENCE THAT ALIENS HAD LANDEDIN NEW JERSEY.
SO THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GOINGTO FALL FOR LIBERAL LIES
ANYMORE. WHICH ISWHY YESTERDAY THEY GOT TO
FINALLY HEAR THE FACTS FROM SOMEOF THEIR OWN.
>> THE E.P.A. ADMINISTRATORS FORFOUR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE
URGED LAWMAKERS TO TAKE ACTIONON CLIMATE CHANGE TODAY.
THE FORMER E.P.A. ADMINISTRATORSONCE WORKED FOR RICHARD NIXON,
GEORGE H.W. BUSH AND HIS SON ANDRONALD REAGAN.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: NIXON, DOUBLE BUSH,
THE GREAT REAGAN HIMSELF,BLESSED BE THY NAME.
YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO WORKFOR THOSE TITANS OF HISTORY
ARE GONNA GIVE US THE STRAIGHTDOPE.
LISTEN UP, TREE-HUGGERS.
>> WE BELIEVE THERE ISLEGITIMATE SCIENTIFIC DEBATE
OVER THE PACE AND EFFECTS OFCLIMATE CHANGE, BUT NO
LEGITIMATE DEBATE OVER THEEFFECTS OF THE EARTH'S WARMING
OR MAN'S CONTRIBUTION.
>> THE ISSUE HAS BEEN SETTLED,THE E.P.A. DOES HAVE THE
AUTHORITY.
THE LAW SAYS SO.
THE SUPREME COURT HAS SAID SOTWICE.
THAT MATTER I BELIEVE SHOULD NOWBE PUT TO REST.
>> Jon: TRAITORS!
TRAITORS!
BRING ME MY SMELLING TURDS.
CLIMATE CHANGE WARNINGS ANDE.P.A. EMPOWERMENT COMING FROM
ACTUAL REPUBLICANS?
THAT'S LIKE BEING TOLD PIZZACAUSES CANCER BY THE TEENAGE
MUTANT NINJA TURTLES WHO LOVEPIZZA.
IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY HARD FORG.O.P.
SENATORS TO ARGUE WITH THIS.
>> I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.
BUT I'M AN OPTOMETRIST.
I SPENT MUCH OF MY LIFE WORKINGWITH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.
I WAS A ZOOLOGY MAJOR.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: "SO IF THIS HEARING IS
ABOUT A ZEBRA WITH ANASTIGMATISM, I'M YOUR GUY.
I'M YOUR GUY."
WELL, AS A MAN WITH A SCIENTIFICBACKGROUND THERE, YOU RECOGNIZE
THAT THE SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUSHERE DISCREDITS THE PEOPLE WHO
DENY CLIMATE CHANGE.
>> AND I SAID BEFORE THATTHERE'S NOTHING SCIENTIFIC ABOUT
DISCREDITING PEOPLE WHO PRESENTCONFLICTING EVIDENCE AND ASK
REASONABLE QUESTIONS.
>> Jon: WELL, LET'S COMPARETHE EVIDENCE AND WE'LL PRESENT
IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE TOSOMEONE WITH YOUR BACKGROUND.
OKAY.
HERE WE GO.
WHICH OF THESE COASTLINES LOOKSBETTER TO YOU.
IS IT A OR B?
A OR B?
YOU CAN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE?
OKAY.
OKAY.
I'M AFRAID YOU MAY HAVE WILLFULBLINDNESS.
ONCE WE CORRECT THE PROBLEM,MAYBE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT
WE HAVE TO REGULATE THE CARBONDIOXIDE THAT'S HEATING THE
ATMOSPHERE.
>> CO2 IS A DIFFERENT KETTLE OFFISH.
IT'S NOT PARTICULATES AND NOXAND SOX.
IT'S PLANT FOOD.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: THAT IS THE SINGLE
MOST CHARMING WAY I HAVE EVERHEARD SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING SO
WRONG.
"YOU KNOW, MY PAPPY TOLD ME, IFYOU TICKLE A FROG AND IT WINKS,
YOU GIRLFRIEND CAN'T GETPREGNANT."
YOU KNOW, THIS GUY IS... HE ISWRONG, BUT HE IS ADORABLE.
HE IS WRONG-DORABLE.
BUT, WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
EVEN IF YOU ACCEPTED THESCIENCE, YOU'D STILL FIND SOME
WAY TO DENIGRATE CLIMATE POLICY,YES?
>> NOW WE HAVE FIRST ROUND OF AGLOBAL WARMING REGULATIONS,
WHICH WILL NATIONALIZE THEELECTRICITY MARKET AND FORCE
AMERICANS TO LIVE OUT THEPRESIDENT'S GREEN DREAM.
>> Jon: THE PRESIDENT'S GREENDREAM.
BY THE WAY, OBAMA'S GREEN DREAM,TOP-SELLING STRAIN IN COLORADO
DISPENSARIES.
NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS, I DON'TKNOW WHAT TO DO NOW, REPUBLICAN
LAWMAKERS WON'T LISTEN TO ALGORE, THEY WON'T LISTEN TO
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON, THEY WON'T
LISTEN TO BILL NYE THESCIENCE GUY.
NOW THEY WON'T EVEN LISTEN TOMEMBERS OF THEIR OWN PARTY.
THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONESOLUTION TO GET REPUBLICANS
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUTCLIMATE CHANGE.
OBAMA MUST BECOME A GLOBALWARMING DENIER.
HE MUST RIDE UP TO CONGRESS IN AHUMMER WITH A GUN RACK AND TELL
THEM, "I WAS WRONG AND YOU ARERIGHT."
WE'D HAVE CAP AND TRADE BY THEMORNING.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
