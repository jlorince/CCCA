[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
THIS PAST WEEK, JUST THIS PASTWEEK, JUST THIS PAST WEEK
GLOBAL LEADERS GATHERED INNEW YORK
FOR THE UNITED NATIONSANNUAL MOTORCADE COMPETITION.
[LAUGHING]BUT APPARENTLY IN BETWEEN
CAUSING TRAFFIC JAMS THEYSOMETIMES MADE SPEECHES.
>> FOR ALL THE IMMEDIATECHALLENGES THAT WE GATHER TO
ADDRESS THIS WEEK. TERRORISM,INSTABILITY, INEQUALITY,
DISEASE, THERE IS ONE ISSUE THATWILL DEFINE THE CONTOURS OF THIS
CENTURY MORE DRAMATICALLY THANANY OTHER.
>> Jon: I'M GOING TO GO WITH --THE TERRIFYING ENTHUSIASM OF ONE
DIRECTION FANS?
[LAUGHING]I HAD TO LOG OFF MY OWN
INSTAGRAM.
THEY'RE VICIOUS.
>> THE URGENT ANDGROWING THREAT OF A CHANGING
CLIMATE.
>> Jon: OH, WELL THAT'S ALSOSCARY.
OKAY.
MAYBE IF WE GET THE ONEDIRECTIONERS UPSET ABOUT CLIMATE
CHANGE. I HEARD --I HEARD HARRY IS
FLOATING OUT TO SEA ON AN ICECAP.
[ APPLAUSE ]NOW THAT WAS PRESIDENT
OBAMA AT LAST WEEK'SU.N. CLIMATE SUMMIT.
ALTHOUGH IN SOME WAYS,THE MOST IMPORTANT
SPEAKERS WERE THE LEADERS OFSEVERAL LOW LYING ISLAND NATIONS
A WHO'S WHO OF WHO'S ALMOSTUNDERWATER.
FROM THE BAHAMAS TO PALAU TOKIRIBATI, ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
AND OF COURSE SAMOA, WHICH ISNOT JUST THE HOME OF
EVERYONE'S THIRD FAVORITE GIRLSCOUT COOKIE.
>> THIS IS IS A OPPORTUNITY TOENSURE THE U.N. IS FIT FOR
PURPOSE WHEN IT COMES TOSUPPORT FOR SIDS.
>> Jon: SIDS?
SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES.
TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO CAN'TCATCH A BREAK. THEY EVEN HAVE
TO SHARE THEIR ACRONYM WITHSUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME.
THAT'S ALMOST AS BAD AS WHEN ICREATED MY MAIL DELIVERY CHARITY
HELPING ELDERLY RETIREES PLANEVENING SUPPER.
[ APPLAUSE ]AND AFTER, YEAH IT'S NOT -- WOW,
I DIDN'T REALIZE I DID THATWHEN I WAS SO YOUNG.
THAT WAS INTERESTING.
YOU KNOW, YOU GET PICTURES OF MENOW, I WORK HERE.
YOU KNOW AFTER HEARING THOSEMOVING SPEECHES WHO WOULDN'T
STAND UP TO TAKE ACTION AGAINSTCLIMATE CHANGE.
>> THE LEADERS OF CHINA ANDINDIA CHOSE NOT TO ATTEND THE
SUMMIT TODAY.
>> Jon: OH REALLY.
THE LEADERS OF INDIA AND CHINACHOSE NOT TO ATTEND.
AND COINCIDENTALLY THEY'VE ALSOCHOSEN TO BE THE FIRST AND THIRD
BIGGEST PRODUCERS OFCARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS.
SURE THE U.S. IS NUMBER TWO, BUTSTILL!
AT LEAST PRESIDENT OBAMA WASTHERE TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
LIKE FOR INSTANCE, EVERYONESAYING THEY NEED TO HAVE A
CARBON TAX.
>> HAN ALSO CALLED FOR PUTTING APRICE ON CARBON.
SOMETHING THE UNITED STATES HASREJECTED.
>> Jon: REJECTED IS SUCH A HARSHWORD.
HOW ABOUT POLITELY DECLINE TOLEGISLATIVELY CONSIDER, BECAUSE
IT MIGHT EFFECT US.
SO DID ANYTHING GET DONE AT THISSUMMIT?
>> SOME OF THE CHALLENGES INREACHING SUCH AN AGREEMENT
WERE ON DISPLAY EVEN TODAY.
BRAZIL, FOR EXAMPLE, SAID ITWOULD NOT SIGN A PLAN TO HALT
DEFORESTATION BY 2030.
>> Jon: YOU CAN'T ASK BRAZIL TOHALT DEFORESTATION.
THAT'S THEIR WHOLE THING.
THE BEST YOU CAN HOPE FOR ISTHAT THEY LEAVE JUST A TINY
STRIP OF RAINFOREST.
[ APPLAUSE ]BUT THE GATHERING --
IT REALLY DOES -- SOUTHAMERICA IS GOING TO LOOK
MUCH BETTER IN A BATHING SUITNOW.
BUT THE GATHERING WASN'T TOTALLYHOPELESS.
ONE UN AGENCY STILL BELIEVESTHAT THE PLANET CAN BE SAVED.
GRANTED IT'S THE AV DEPARTMENT.
>> ONE DAY WE WILL WAKE UP TOFIND THAT THE ENERGY THAT POWERS
THE ALARM CLOCK CAME THROUGH THEBREEZE THROUGH THE TREES.
IT WON'T SCAR THE LAND OR POISONTHE SEAS.
THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET TOTHAT DAY FROM WHERE WE ARE
TODAY?
ALL 7.3 BILLION OF US.
>> Jon: WOW, NICELY DONE. BUTIF YOU WANT TO CAPTURE THE FULL
GRAVITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE, MAYBEYOU SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN A
DIFFERENT MORGAN FREEMANMONOLOGUE.
>> THIS IS IT. IF THE WORLD DOESGO ON,
IT WILL NOT GO ON FOR EVERYONE.
NEW YORK CITY, BOSTON, ATLANTA,PHILADELPHIA, ALL WILL BE
DESTROYED.
SO, THAT'S IT.
GOOD LUCK TO US ALL.
>> Jon: WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. IHOPE.
