WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE
PRESIDENT OF AMERICANS FOR TAX
REFORM.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED
DEBACLE.
OBAMA'S WAR ON JOBS AND GROWTH
AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO REGAIN
OUR FUTURE.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM GROVER NOR QUIST.
( APPLAUSE )
YOU'RE HERE.
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
>> Jon: THE EVIL GROVER
NORQUIST.
>> SWEETY PIE.
>> Jon: DEBACLE.
YOU'VE COME UP WITH A PLEDGE.
HERE'S WHERE YOU SEEM TO HAVE
STEPPED IN IT.
YOU CAME UP WITH THIS PLEDGE
THAT NOBODY IS... YOU DON'T
WANT PEOPLE TO RAISE TAXES
EVER.
YOU GOT A BUNCH OF REPUBLICANS
TO SIGN IT.
MOSTLY REPUBLICANS SIGN IT.
IT STRIKES ME AS PEOPLE CAN
COME UP WITH ANY PLEDGE THEY
WANT.
THE PEOPLE SEEM LIKE AT FAULT
FOR THIS IF YOU DON'T FEEL
LIKE THIS IS A GOOD THING ARE
THE PEOPLE WHO SIGN IT.
I CAN COME WITH ANY PLEDGE....
>> THERE HAVE BEEN OVER TIME
QUITE A NUMBER OF
QUESTIONNAIRES AND PLEDGES AND
THINGS THAT SOMEBODY SAYS YOU
SHOULD MAKE ALL THESE
COMMITMENTS.
THE REASON WHY THE PLEDGE HAS
BEEN SUCCESSFUL IS THAT IT'S
SIMPLE.
IT DOESN'T... THERE ARE NOT 12
MOVING PARTS.
SOME GROUP IN IOWA HAD LIKE A
14-PART PLEDGE INCLUDING HOW
YOU SPENT YOUR EVENINGS AND
THEY WANT CANDIDATES TO SIGN
IT.
>> Jon: THAT'S MY GROUP "THE
HOW YOU SPENT YOUR EVENINGS"
PLEDGE.
>> THEY COULDN'T GET A LOT OF
SIGNERS.
THE PLEDGE IS, LOOK AS LONG AS
I'M A CONGRESSMAN, SENATOR OR
PRESIDENT I'M NOT GOING TO
RAISE TAXES.
WHEN I SEE A FORMER I'M GOING
TO REFORM GOVERNMENT AND SPEND
LESS.
I'M NOT GOING TO RAISE TAXES.
EVER.
>> Jon: ABSOLUTIST.
>> AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN
CONGRESS YOU DON'T EXPECT TO
BE THERE FOR 500 YEARS.
AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN CONGRESS
OR THE STATE LEGISLATURE.
>> Jon: IS THERE A PRESIDENT
THAT WOULD HAVE EVER LIVED UP
TO THE PLEDGE THAT THEY WOULD
HAVE SIGNED INCLUDING THE
PATRON SAINT FOR MOST
REPUBLICANS RONALD REAGAN.
WOULD HE HAVE LIVED UP TO THAT
PLEDGE?
>> I DESIGNED THE PLEDGE WITH
REAGAN SUPPORT IN '86 IN ORDER
TO GET THE TAX REFORM ACT OF
'86 ENACTED.
THE REASON WAS....
>> Jon: ALTHOUGH THE TAX
REFORM ACT RAISE TAXES.
>> IT WAS REVENUE NEUTRAL.
>> Jon: LOOPHOLES.
>> I'M IN FAVOR OF CLOSING
LOOPHOLES AND REDUCE RATES AT
THE SAME TIME.
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT A TROJAN
HORSE FOR A TAX INCREASE
THERE'S A BILK VOTED ON
TOMORROW IN THE SENATE WHICH
TAKES ALL OF THOSE TAX CREDITS
AT THE VARIOUS ENERGY
COMPANIES GET, ELIMINATES ALL
THE TAX CREDITS THAT ARE
SPECIFIC TO ENERGY AND REDUCES
RATES.
REVENUE NEUTRAL.
GETS RID OF ALL THOSE
DISTORTIONS, ALL THAT THE
ETHANOL TAX CREDIT AND SOME OF
THE ONES THAT THE OIL AND
NATURAL GAS GUYS GET.
YOU'LL FIND OUT TOMORROW WHO
IS FOR GETTING RID OF
FAVORITES, FATE RITISM AND
SPECIAL TAX CREDIT WITHOUT
RAISING REVENUE, WITHOUT
RAISING TAXES NET.
>> Jon: WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA
THOUGH THAT BECAUSE IT'S SO
SIMPLE AND SO ABSOLUTIST THAT
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.
LIKE IF I HAD A PLEDGE THAT
SAID AMERICA CAN NEVER GO TO
WAR.
AND I GOT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TO
SIGN IT.
PEOPLE WOULD THINK THAT'S
UNREALISTIC.
IT'S TOO SIMPLISTIC FOR THIS
COMPLEX WORLD.
DO YOU WORRY THAT YOUR PLEDGE,
I MEAN REAGAN RAISED TAXES
SEVEN OR EIGHT TIMES.
>> AND GEORGE WASHINGTON LOST
THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK.
THAT WAS NOT ON PURPOSE.
I MEAN REAGAN DIDN'T WANT TO
RAISE TAXES.
>> Jon: REAGAN DIDN'T WANT TO
RAISE TAXS?
>> NO.
>> Jon: BUT HE DID IT EIGHT
TIMES?
>> NO.
HE HAD A CONGRESS WITH WHOM HE
RAISED TAXES A NUMBER OF
TIMES.
WHEN I TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT,
THE BIG TAX INCREASE WAS THE
'2 TAX INCREASE.
>> Jon: YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
ONE HE TALKED TO.
HE TOLD ME HE DID IT EIGHT
TIMES.
>> THE '82 TAX INKURRI HE SAID
WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF HIS
PRESIDENCY BECAUSE, OF COURSE,
REMEMBER HE WAS PROMISED, OH,
IF YOU RAISE TAXES WE'LL GIVE
YOU $3 SPENDING.
>> Jon: HE KEPT RAISING THEM
IN '82, '83, '85.
SO WOULD YOU HAVE RUN SOMEBODY
AGAINST HIM?
>> NO.
THE GOOD NEWS IS....
>> Jon: WHY NOT?
>> WELL, ONE HE HADN'T SIGNED
THE PLEDGE.
>> Jon: (LAUGHING).
IT'S A GOOD THING IT'S NOT
REDUCTIVE.
>> LOOK, THE REASON WHY THE
PLEDGE WORKS IS THAT YOU HAVE...
WE NOW HAVE THE EXPERIENCE
FROM THE REAGAN YEARS THAT IF
YOU RAISE TAXES, IT DOESN'T
REDUCE THE DEFICIT.
THE OTHER TEAM WILL SIMPLY
SPEND THE RESOURCES.
>> Jon: THERE WAS A HUGE TAX
CUT AND HE WENT FROM A SURPLUS
TO A DEFICIT.
DOES THAT PUT ANY KIND OF
DOUBT IN YOUR MIND ABOUT THE
SIMPLISTIC NATURE OF THE
PLEDGE VERSUS THE REAL WORLD
OF THE ECONOMY?
>> NO.
THE PLEDGE IS STEP ONE.
DON'T RAISE TAXES.
STEP TWO-- AND THIS IS WHERE
GEORGE W. BUSH MESSED UP--
STOP SPENDING SO MUCH MONEY.
>> Jon: BUT WHERE IS THAT
PLEDGE?
BECAUSE THE FIRST PLEDGE IS
EASY.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> THAT'S WHERE... WHAT THE
TEA PARTY DID WHEN THEY CAME
IN IN 2009-2010 AND SAID TO
THE REPUBLICANS AND SHOOK THEM
UP THE NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS
WHO HAD BEEN SPENDING TOO MUCH
MONEY.
PEOPLE LOST ON THE SPENDING
ISSUE.
I MEAN THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE
THAT PEOPLE HAD LOST ELECTIONS
ON BEFORE.
>> Jon: HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
IT'S VERY EASY... THERE IS
NOTHING PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR
MORE THAN YOU GIVE US TOO MUCH
MONEY, YOU SHOULD KEEP MORE.
THAT'S THE EASY PART.
I'VE GOT A PLEDGE.
ICE CREAM AND CAKE FOR
EVERYBODY.
HERE'S MY SECOND PLEDGE.
OH, YOU HAVE TO EXERCISE.
I'M NOT GOING TO ENFORCE THAT
ONE BUT WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET
THINNER.
WHEN YOU COME OUT AND YOU SAY
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO RAISE
TAXES, I UNDERSTAND THAT IS A
GREAT BRANDING.
BUT AS A GOVERNING POLICY, IT
SEEMS TOO EASY AND PANDERING.
>> I UNDERSTAND BUT THAT'S
ACTUALLY THE GOOD NEWS IS IF
PEOPLE TAKE THE PLEDGE AND
KEEP IT-- AND THE REASON WHY
PEOPLE TAKE THE PLEDGE IS
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WITH A
RAISE TAXES.
THEY DON'T NOT RAISE TAXES
BECAUSE THEY TOOK THE PLEDGE.
IT WORKS THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
THE PLEDGE ALLOWS SOMEBODY TO
CREDIBLEY EXPLAIN TO VOTERS, I
MEAN IT.
EVERYBODY WATCHED WHAT
HAPPENED TO GEORGE HERBERT
WALKER BUSH WHEN HE BROKE HIS
PLEDGE HE THREW AWAY A
PERFECTLY GOOD PRESIDENT.
>> Jon: EVERYBODY WATCHED WHAT
HAPPENS WITH GEORGE W. BUSH
WHERE HE KEEPS THE PLEDGE AND
WE GO FROM A SURPLUS TO A
DEFICIT.
BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT THINGS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S SO EASY TO SAY
LET'S JUST CUT GOVERNMENT
SPENDING AND LET'S GIVE
EVERYBODY THEIR MONEY BACK.
WHERE ARE ALL THE TRAFFIC
LIGHTS AGAIN?
( APPLAUSE )
THAT'S A REALITY THAT WE
ALWAYS COME UP AGAINST.
IT SEEMS LIKE THE PLEDGE TAKES
SPENDING AND VALUE AND
DECOUPLES THEM AS THOUGH ALL
SPENDING IS THE SAME.
>> WHAT IT DOES IS IT'S THE
FIRST PART OF REFORM IN THE
GOVERNMENT.
DON'T RAISE TAXES.
RAISING TAXES IS WHAT
POLITICIANS DO INSTEAD OF
GOVERNING.
INSTEAD OF MAKING HARD
DECISIONS.
INSTEAD OF SAYING NO TO ALL
THE SPECIAL INTERESTS YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.
IF TAX INCREASES ARE ON THE
TABLE EVERY SPECIAL INTEREST
COMES TO WASHINGTON OR AL BANY
AND SAYS, HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME MONEY.
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO GIVE
YOU.
GO RAISE TAXES AND THEN GIVE
ME MONEY.
>> Jon: MOST GOVERNMENT
SPENDING TAKES PLACE IN TAX
LOOPHOLES.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND FOR A
SECOND BECAUSE I FIND THAT THE
KIDS AT HOME ALWAYS SAY TO ME
I LOVE YOUR TAX POLICY
DISCUSSIONS BUT THEY'RE TOO
SHORT.
PUT IT ON THE WEBB.
DEBACLE ON THE BOOK SHELVES
NOW.
GROVER NORQUIT.
