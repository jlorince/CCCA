>> John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER.
I'M STILL SITTING IN FOR JON
STEWART.
HE IS WAITING AT HOME FOR TIME
WARNER TO COME FIX HIS CABLE.
THEY SAID THEY'D BE THERE
BETWEEN NOON AND 2:00 ON JUNE
10.
FRANKLY HE'S STILL WAITING
THERE.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM PROJECT
RUNWAY, MR. TIM GUNN IS WITH US.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
A GLORIOUS HUMAN BEING.
BUT WE START TONIGHT WITH
JUSTICE.
NOW EARLIER THIS SUMMER WE HEARD
A LOT ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT
WHICH LIKEDDED GAY MARRIAGE BUT
NOT SOUTHERN MINORITIES' ABILITY
TO VOTE FOR IT.
BUT THERE ARE OTHER MUCH LESS
SUPREME COURTS.
DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE
SITTING IN ONE RIGHT NOW?
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S TIME FOR TONIGHT'S
INSTALLMENT OF JUDGE JOHNNY.
BAIL LIVE, SHOOT THAT MAN.
>> YOU ARE ABOUT TO ENTER THE
COURTROOM OF JUDGE JOHNNY
OLIVER.
>> MELISSA, PLEASE PASS YOUR
KNIVES AND GO.
>> HE'S NOT LEGALLY TRAINED.
HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE
JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS BASED
ENTIRELY ON RERUNS OF NIGHT
COURT.
>> ALL RIGHT, BOYS, HIT THE
SHOWERS.
>> HIS DECISIONS ARE GENERALLY
BAD.
THIS IS JUDGE JOHNNY.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> COURT IS IN SESSION.
JASON JONES, PLEASE CALL
TONIGHT'S FIRST DEFENDANT.
>> JUDGE JOHNNY, THE PEOPLE CALL
THE HALLIBURTON CORPORATION.
YOU MAY KNOW THEM AS DICK
CHENEYs FORMER COMPANY THAT
WAS AWARDED SWEETHEART DEALS IN
IRAQ, BRIBED NIGERIAN OFFICIALS,
PLED GUILTY TO VIOLATING THE
LIBYAN EMBARGO IN THE '90s AND
WAS STILL DOING BUSINESS WITH
IRAN AS LATE AS 2007.
THEY'VE DODGED JUSTICE SO FAR,
BUT WE'LL SEE IF THOSE
SHENANIGANS HOLD UP IN FRONT OF
JUDGE JOHNNY.
>> THANKS, JASON.
SO, I SEE THAT THIS CASE
CONCERNS THE AFTER MATH OF THE
B.P. DEEP WATER HORIZON OIL
SPILL.
WHAT'S THE CHARGE?
>> CEMENT USED BY HALLIBURTON
CONTRACTORS TO SEAL THE B.P.
WELL AGAINST EXPLOSIVE GASES WAS
UNSTABLE.
BOTH COMPANIES KNEW THIS TWO
MONTHS BEFORE THE DISASTER.
>> THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS
DESTROYED WAS PART OF SEVERAL
SIMULATIONS CONDUCTED IN THIS
POST INCIDENT EXAMINATION.
SNOP POOR PLANNING LEADING TO
MAJOR DESTRUCTION FOLLOWED BY
LYING AND COVER-UPS?
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS
MAN EVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH
HALLIBURTON.
WELL, STRAP IN, EVERYONE.
WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT A LONG
COURT BATTLE IF HALLIBURTON
TRIES TO SNAKE THEIR WAY OUT OF
THIS.
>> HALLIBURTON ENERGY SERVICES
HAS AGREED TO PLEAD GUILTY TO
DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS THE
COMPANY HAS AGREED TO PAY THE
MAXIMUM AVAILABLE FINE.
>> John: WOW, THE MAXIMUM
AVAILABLE FINE.
WHAT IS THAT?
A BAJILLION DOLLARS PLUS
INFINITY HOURS OF COMMUNITY
SERVICE, WRITING A HANDWRITTEN
APOLOGY NOTE TO EVERY LIVING
CREATURE AFFECTED BY THE SPILL?
JUDGE JOHNNY APPROVES OF THIS.
BUT JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, WHAT
ACTUALLY IS THE MAXIMUM FINE?
>> THE MAXIMUM STATUTORY FINE IN
THIS CASE, THAT IS $200,000.
>> John: $200,000?
SO YOU CAN RUIN THE GULF COAST
AND DESTROY THE EVIDENCE ALL FOR
THE PRICE OF FOUR TOYOTA AVALONS
AND HALF A SEMESTER AT N.Y.U.?
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HOLD ON.
MAYBE THIS IS GOOD NEWS.
LET ME JUST DO THE MATH HERE.
200 MILLION GAL ONS SPILLED.
THAT COMES OUT OF ONE TENTH OF A
CENT PER GALLON SO WE DID IT.
WE BROUGHT DOWN OIL PRICES.
HERE IS THE AMAZING THING.
THAT PUNISHMENT WAS SO LIGHT,
EVEN HALLIBURTON WAS
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT.
>> HALLIBURTON MADE A VOLUNTARY
CONTRIBUTION OF $55 MILLION TO
THE NATIONAL FISH AND WILDLIFE
FOUNDATION THAT WAS NOT
CONDITIONED ON THE COURT'S
ACCEPTANCE OF ITS PLEA
AGREEMENT.
>> John: MONEY THAT PRESUMABLY
WENT TOWARD ALL THOSE FISH
WIDOWS FINALLY GIVING THEIR
HUSBANDS THE FUNERALS THEY
DESERVE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
FISH CONDUCT FUNERALS LIKE
FLUSHING THEIR LOVED ONES DOWN A
SOLID GOLD TOILET.
THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO FORGET
THEM SEVEN SECONDS LATER.
BUT HALLIBURTON ESCAPES JUSTICE
ONCE AGAIN.
HOPEFULLY AT LEAST THEY'LL PAY
THE PRICE IN THE STOCK MARKET.
>> WITH THIS DEAL, CAROL, THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS AGREEING
TO NOT PURSUE ANY MORE CRIMINAL
CHARGES AGAINST HALLIBURTON.
ON THIS NEWS, HALLIBURTON SHARES
ARE UP 2% IN FREE MARKET
TRADING.
>> John: THE SHARES WENT UP?
OKAY.
I'M READY TO RULE ON THIS.
IN THE CASE OF HALLIBURTON
VERSUS ANY SENSE OF HUMANITY, I
FIND THAT HALLIBURTON CAN GO EAT
A BAG OF THIS.
ORDER.
