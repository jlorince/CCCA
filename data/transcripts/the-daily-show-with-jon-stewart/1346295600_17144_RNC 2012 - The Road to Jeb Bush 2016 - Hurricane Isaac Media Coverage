WHAT IS HAPPENING?
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.
DAY TWO.
IT IS DAY TWO FOR US HERE IN...
BEAUTIFUL TAMPA.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW INSECURE THESE PEOPLE ARE.
(LAUGHTER) OUR GUEST TONIGHT, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MR. HERMAN CAIN WILL BE JOINING US!
LAST NIGHT WAS A VERY COMPLICATED NIGHT FOR THE CABLE NETWORKS, BUT THEY DID MANAGE TO
SUCCESSFULLY MOUNT FULL TEAM COVERAGE OF NIGHT ONE OF THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION WHILE
SAME-SEX COUPLELY AIRING COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF HURRICANE PORN FROM YOUR STANDARD GUY OUTSIDE IN THE
RAIN TO WOMEN IN RAIN BURKAS STANDING UNDER THE GUTTER OF DAMOCLES TO GUY ABOUT TO BE
SUCKED OUT TO THE SEA.
(LAUGHTER) TO REPORTERS SO DRENCHED THEY TRANSFORM INTO WATER CREATURES.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) PEOPLE, I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH AT HOME: DON'T GO CHASING WATERFALLS.
(LAUGHTER) MR. ANDERSON COOPER WAS THERE WHERE HE AND AN EQUALLY HANDSOME
ROB MARCIANO DID NOT APPARENTLY REALIZE THEY COULD JUST MOVE FROM THE SPOT WHERE WATER WAS
DRAINING OFF THE TOP OF THE TENT ON TOP OF THEM TO A DRIER PLACE UNDERNEATH SAID TENT!
(LAUGHTER) IF YOU'VE GOT TO WATERBOARD ONE OF YOUR GUYS, CNN...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) HUH?
