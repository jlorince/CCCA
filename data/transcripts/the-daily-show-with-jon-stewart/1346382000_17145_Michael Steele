>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
WITH US TONIGHT, THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, CURRENTLY
SHE A POLITICAL ANALYST FOR MSNBC, PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM MICHAEL STEELE!
>> IT IS SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
YOU WERE THE RNC CHAIRMAN.
>> YEAH.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
>> Jon: AND SO NOW THE RNC GENTLEMAN IS A PERSON NAMED A MADE-UP NAME.
REINCE PRIEBUS.
>> YES, SIR.  THAT IS CORRECT.
>> I SAW HIM, I WANTED TO SHOW YOU THIS.
SHOW THE TAPE QUICKLY OF REINCE PRIEBUS.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS NEVER RUN A COMPANY.
HE HASN'T EVEN RUN A GARAGE SALE OR SEEN THE INSIDE OF A LEMONADE STAND.
>> Jon: NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE EVER SEEN THE MOVIE ARTHUR WITH --
>> VERY MUCH.
>> Jon: AND HOW WAS THAT?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> Jon: NO LOVE LOST.
NOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LEAVE?  DO YOU GET TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF YOUR LABOR AT THIS
CONVENTION?  OR ARE YOU PERSONA NON GRATA IN THE HALLS OF PARTY POWER.
>> YES, THAT WOULD BE ALL BY MYSELF.
>> Jon: OH, REALLY?  ..
>> NO INVITATION.
NO CREDENTIALS.
>> THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS.
>> Jon: THAT IS NOT RIGHT.
HOW DO YOU REPAIR THAT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WITH A PARTY?  OR ARE YOU NOT INTERESTED IN THAT?
>> I AM NOT INTERESTED IN THAT.
LOOK THE BOTTOM LINE IS I WAS HIRED TO DO TWO THINGS, ONE RAISE MONEY, $198 MILLION AND
WIN ELECTIONS, 53 SEATS IN THE HOUSE, MANY LEGISLATIVE SEATS IN THE COMPANY AND FLIPPED A NUMBER
OF LEGISLATURES, AND CONGRESSMEN, TIM SCOTT TO ALAN WEST, SUSANNA MARTINEZ WHO WAS
AWESOME THE OTHER NIGHT.
>> I CAN SEE WHY THEY GOT RID OF YOU.
>> YES, EXACTLY.
>> Jon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
DO YOU KNOW PAUL RYAN?
>> YES, VERY WELL.
>> Jon: NOW HE IS CONSIDERED IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, AND I AM USING JUST A NICKNAME, THE BRAINIAC.
>> HE IS THE INTEL BECK CHUL SOUL OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> THERE IS A LOT OF GRAVITATION TO HIM, HIS BOLDNESS TO PUT A PLAN IN WRITING ON THE TABLE
WHICH HE KNEW WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, ADVICE RATED AND TAKEN APART, AND INTERESTINGLY MUST
HAVE NOT JUST BY THE LEFT BUT ALSO BY THE RIGHT, BECAUSE FOLKS FORGET -- NEWT GINGRICH SHOWED
IT RIGHT WING SOCIAL ENGINEERING.
>> YOU HAVE THAT AND BEFORE THAT YOU HAVE THE LEADERSHIP WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE PLAN AND
ASKED ABOUT IT SAY THAT IS NOT OUR PLAN.
SO HE KNEW FULL WELL WHAT THE RISK WOULD BE BUT HE WAS WILLING TO TAKE IT AND SO MY ARGUMENT TO
HIM WAS DO IT NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: WERE YOU SURPRISED LAST NIGHT WHEN HE GAVE A SPEECH THAT WAS DEVOID OF THOSE KINDS
OF POLICIES AND BOLDNESS AND INCLUDED FOR A GUY WITH A REPUTATION OF BEING FROM WHAT
EVERYBODY SAYS A STRAIGHT SHOOTER, A GUY OF HARD TRUTHS THAT PLAYED SO FAST AND LOOSE
WITH CONTEXT AND FACTS?  DID THAT SURPRISE YOU AND WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM THE
CAMPAIGN?  IF YOU STAND NEAR MITT ROMNEY YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY DELUDED?  WHAT
HAPPENED TO THAT MAN THAT WE HEARD ABOUT THAT, BUT THEN WHAT WE SAW.
>> IT IS LIKE BEFORE.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I AM SAYING.
THAT'S WHAT I AM SAYING.
>> NO.
THE FACT OF IT IS, AND I UNDERSTAND VERY MUCH WHERE YOU ARE COMING FROM BUT YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE CONVENTIONS ARE, YOU KNOW,
DESIGNED TO DO.
THEY ARE LARGELY INFOMERCIALS,
THEY ARE NOT REALLY TO GET INTO THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF SUBSTANCE OF THE ARGUMENT.
THAT IS WHAT THE NEXT SIX, SEVEN WEEKS ARE GOING TO BE ABOUT.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND THE INFOMERCIAL IDEA BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE INFOMERCIAL IS TO GET
PEOPLE TO BUY A PRODUCT.
>> WELL, YOU SAID IT IN, YOU SAY SOME BROAD THINGS AND GIVE PEOPLE AN IDEA WHERE YOU WANT TO
GO AND, THAT IS WHAT GETS FOLKS FIRED UP AND LAY OUT THEMATICALLY WHAT YOUR VISION IS.
NOW THE INTERESTING THING THAT YOU NOTE AND YOU ARE VERY GOOD AT THIS.
YOU ARE PUSHING IT.
>> Jon: 80 YEARS.
>> THE NEW AGE OF INFORMATION IS CHANGING, I THINK WILL CHANGE THE WAY THESE CONVENTIONS ARE
RUN AND THE INFORMATION THAT YOU GET OUT OF THEM, BECAUSE THERE IS MORE PUSH BY THE AMERICAN
CITIZENS TO SAY I WANT TO KNOW NOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
DON'T DRAG IT OUT, JUST --
>> Jon: YOU ARE SAYING DEMAND TO UPHOLD A STANDARD OF TRUTH.
>> YES.
EXACTLY.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
MICHAEL STEELE IS JOINING US.
WE ARE GOING TO THROW A LITTLE BIT UP ON THE WEB.
