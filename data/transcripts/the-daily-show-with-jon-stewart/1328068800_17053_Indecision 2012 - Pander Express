>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE ""DAILY SHOW"." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH, WHAT A SHOW TONIGHT.
MY GUEST-- IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD ONE-- MY GUEST, JONATHAN MACEY, A PROFESSOR AT YALE LAW
SCHOOL, YALE BUSINESS SCHOOL,
AND YALE'S PRESCHOOL.
VERY BUSY.
LAW  ( LAUGHTER ) FIRST I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT PANDERING.
I MEAN, SURE, IT MAY LOOK EASY,
AS EASY AS THE GIANTS WINNING THE SUPER BOWL THIS SUNDAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
PANDER, AND THAT DIDN'T WORK.
I GOT BOOED IN MY OWN STUDIO.
IT CAN BE SURPRISINGLY TRICKY.
FOR INSTANCE, RIGHT NOW, NEWT GINGRICH IN FLORIDA IS TRYING TO WIN OVER HISPANIC VOTERES, A
TASK MADE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BY THE FACT BEFORE HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT, NEWT GINGRICH SAID
THINGS LIKE THIS.
>> WE SHOULD REPLACE BILINGUAL EDUCATION WITH IMMERSION IN ENGLISH SO THEY LEARN THE
LANGUAGE OF PROSPERITY, NOT THE LANGUAGE OF LIVING IN A GHETTO.
( BOOING )  ( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT AT "WHO'S LINE IS IT ANYWAY?"
( LAUGHTER ) TO BE FAIR, NEWT GINGRICH DIDN'T
KNOW WHEN HE SAID THAT, THAT HE WAS GOING TO NEED HISPANIC PEOPLE TO LIKE HIM.
( LAUGHTER ) THE PROBLEM IS THAT NOW THAT
GINGRICH IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HE HAS TO GET HELPING VOTERS ON HIS SIDE.
>> THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE YOU SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO THE INTERVIEW IN SPANISH, BUT TODAY
I THINK WE'LL STICK TO ENGLISH.
>> I CAN LISTEN TO SOME OF YOUR SPANISH IF YOU GO SLOW, BUT I'M TOO TIMID TO RESPOND.
I SPEAK PIGEON SPANISH.
>> Jon:  OH!
THAT NOW THANKS A SENSE.
NEWT LEARNED SPANISH FROM PIGEONS.
NO WONDER HE'S SAYING IT'S THE LANGUAGE OF THE GHETTO.
THOSE BIRDSES ARE FILTHY ( SPEAKING SPANISH )
>> NO, NOT ( SPEAKING SPANISH.
>> UH, NO, I DIDN'T FOLLOW YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T FOLLOW YOU.
ALL MY SPANISH IS LONG-CARE RELATED.
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT EL HEDGEOS, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
OF COURSE, NEWT'S OUTREACH TO HISPANIC VOTERS HAS COINEDDED WITH THE FLORIDA PRIMARY.
YOU HAVE TO GO FOR THE GRAY HAIRS, THE OLD STORIES, THE WRINKLE FACTORIES, THE DEATH ADJACENT.
( LAUGHTER ) AND MITT ROMNEY IS ALL OVER THEM
LIKE WHILE THE ON MITT ROMNEY.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
HE MADE AN APPEARANCE YESTERDAY AT THE VILLAGES, A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY THAT IS SO LARGE, HAS
SO MANY OLD PEOPLE, EVEN FLORIDIANS REFER TO THE VILLAGES AS "THAT PLACE WITH ALL THE OLD
PEOPLE."  ( LAUGHTER ) TRY GETTING A HANDICAPPED PARK
SPACE AT THE VILLAGES.
( LAUGHTER ) SO WHAT APPROACH DID MITT TAKE
TO PANDER TO THE OLDIES.
BINGO?
MAHJONG, A PROMISE TO BRING BACK "CAGNEY AND LACY."
>> WHEN I WAS A BOY, MY MOM AND DAD PUT US IN HIS CAR AND TOOK
US AROUND TO THE NATIONAL PARKS.
WE CAME HERE AND SAW CYPRESS GARDENS AND THE OCEANS, WENT WEST AND SAW THE CANYON--
CANYONES, ACTUALLY, RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS AND FELL IN LOVE WITH THE LAND IN AMERICA.
THERE WAS A-- THERE WAS A SONG THAT CAPTURES THAT FOR ME.
>> Jon:  IT GOES LIKE THIS--  ( LAUGHTER )
"I LIKE BIG BUTTS YOU'RE THE BROTHER  ♪ THAT'S WHEN A GIRL WALKS IN
WITH AN ITTY-BITTY WAIST  ♪ ♪  ( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE ) I'VE BROKEN MY COSSIC BONE.
TELL ME, TELL ME, MITT ROMNEY IS NOT ABOUT TO WOO ELDERLY VOTERS WITH THE POWER OF SONG.
>> YOU CAN SING THAT SONG?
I LOVE THAT SONG.
DO YOU KNOW THAT SONG  ♪ OH, BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES
FOR AMBER WAVES OF GRAIN  ♪ ♪.
>> Jon:  OKAY, NOW, JUST FOR WIDOWS!
OKAY!
( APPLAUSE ) THE DIABETICS!
( APPLAUSE ) ANYBODY ON A JAZZY.
( APPLAUSE ) ALL RIGHT.
YOU SANG A VERSE OF "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL." VERY NICE.
NOW IF WE CAN MOVE ON.
>> THERE'S ANOTHER VERSE.
I WON'T MAKE YOU SING IT BECAUSE YOU WON'T ALL KNOW THE WORDS
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP NO ONE KNOWS THE WORDS IS THAT NO ONE EVER
CERTIFICATES THEIR AUDIENCES TO TWO VERSES OF THAT SONG.
(  LAUGHTER  ) WAS HE STALLING FOR TIME SO A
PICK POCKET COULD WORK THE CROWD?
WRAP IT UP, MAN.
>> WOW, THANK YOU.
GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THANK YOU.
WOW.
IMPRESSIVE.
AND ONE MORE VERSE THAT'S NOT AS FAMILIAR TO SOME.
( LAUGHTER )  ( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:  IT WAS THEN THAT EVERYONE IN THE CROWD AT THE VILLAGES PRESSED THEIR LIFE
ALERT BUTTON AT THE SAME TIME.
AND FAKED A STROKE.
(  LAUGHTER  )
