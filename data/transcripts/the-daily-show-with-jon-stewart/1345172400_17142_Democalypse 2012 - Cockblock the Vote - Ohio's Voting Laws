THAT AT A SHELL TER.
BUT AS RIDICULOUS AS THIS VOTER I.D. BUSINESS IT IS NOT LIKE PENNSYLVANIA IS
DOING SOMETHING CRAZY LIKE GIVING REPUBLICAN COUNTIES MORE TIME TO VOTE THEN DEMOCRATIC COUNTIES.
THEY'RE NOT CRAZY.
>> THE LATEST TWIST ON THIS HAS REPUBLICANS IN OHIO RESTRICTING EARLY VOTING
HOURS ON DEMOCRATIC COUNTIES BUT EXTENDING EARLY VOTING HOURS IN THE REPUBLICAN ONES.
>> Jon: ARE YOU-- [BLEEP]
KIDDING ME!
ALL AMERICANS WHO WANT EQUAL ACCESS TO THE VOTE TAKE TWO-STEPS FORWARD, NOT SO
FAST PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON MARTIN LUTHER KING BOULEVARD SOUTH.
NOW YOU MIGHT WONDER HOW IT WOULD EVEN BE POSSIBLE FOR OHIO TO DIVIDE UP VOTING
HOURS BY HOW DISTRICTS VOTE.
FUNNY STORY.
OHIO COUNTY ELECTION BOARD EACH HAVE TWO REPUBLICANS AN TWO DEMOCRATS AND THE GUY
WHO BREAKS THE TIE IN ESTABLISHING POWERS IS OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN HOUSTON.
REPUBLICAN.
GUESS WHO HE HAS BEEN SIDING WITH.
IT'S AS FAIR AS WHEN YOUR DAD BREAKS THE TIE BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR MOM OVER
WHETHER YOU GET TO STAY OUT ALL NIGHT DRINKING.
EXCEPT INSTEAD OF STAYING OUT ALL NIGHT DRINKING, IT'S VOTING.
MAYBE I'M MISSING SOMETHING.
PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW FEWER PEOPLE VOTING SOMEHOW ENHANCES THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THE BAR IS TOO HIGH THERE FOR ANYBODY WHO REALLY CARES
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND WANTS TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD BY VOTING.
WE TRY TO MAKE IT EASY BUT WE CAN'T, YOU KNOW, I SAY WE'RE NOT 7-11.
WE CAN'T STAY OPEN 24/7 AND LET ANYBODY VOTE BY ANY RULE THAT THEY WANT TO.
>> Jon: SURELY WE CAN'T EXPECT OUR CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED VOTING RIGHTS TO
MEET THE SAME HIGH STANDARDS AS A COMBINATION GAS STATION CONVENIENCE STORE.
(LAUGHTER) NEED I REMIND YOU OF THE STRICT DRESS CODE.
NOT SURPRISINGLY, THIS SITUATION AND THE RULING PROVOKES A NATIONAL OUTCRY.
>> AFTER HEAVY CRITICISM,
OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE HAS JUST ORDERED THAT ALL 88 COUNTIES IN THAT STATE HAVE
TO ABIDE BY THE SAME EARLY VOTING RULES.
>> AND I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT TOO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT MEDDLING CONSTITUTION AND OF COURSE THOSE KIDS IN
THAT VAN.
THEY REALLY WERE THE ONES IT THAT REALLY--  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>>> TWO THINGS, TWO STATES,
TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MEANS OF SUPPRESSING DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT.
HERE IS THE ONE THING I HAVE IN COMMON.
THE MECHANISM OF THE VOTE ARE IN THE HANDS OF PARTISAN ELECTED OFFICIALS.
PERHAPS'S IT'S TIME THE WHEELS OF SOCIETY TOOK OUR CUES FROM OTHER HIGHLY
EVOLVED DEMOCRACIES AND ELECTION OVERSIGHT LIKE THEY DO IN MEXICO, CANADA, INDIA
AND OF COURSE RWANDA.
THAT'S RIGHT.
A PLACE SO TERRIBLE DON CHEADLE MADE A MOVIE ABOUT A HOTEL THERE.
NO, THAT'S THE OTHER-- YEAH.
