>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE PROGRAM LISA P. JACKSON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: VERY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU AS WELL.
>> Jon: I FEEL SO BADLY.
YOU KNOW, WITH YOU WERE POISED, JOHN KERRY, JOE LIEBERMAN, LIND SI GRAHAM THEY WERE POISED TO
INTRODUCE CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION.
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN KING FOR A DAY IN WASHINGTON WHEN IT COMES OUT.
LINDSEY GRAHAM BACKS OFF BECAUSE OF IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: HOW CLOSE WERE YOU TO HAVING YOUR PROJECT ON THE TOP TKOFBGT?
>> WELL, -- TOP DOCKET?
>> WE WERE PRETTY CLOSE TO HAVING THE DISCUSSION START TO MOVE IN THE U.S. SENATE FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WAS GOING
TO BIPARTISAN.
THE SUPPORT OF SENATOR GRAHAM COULDN'T BE UNDERESTIMATED.
HE HAS WORKED A LONG TIME TO MAKE IT A BIPARTISAN -- ACTUALLY TRIPARTISAN --
>> Jon: DO YOU FEEL LIKE SENATOR GRAHAM IS A BIG FAT BABY?
[LAUGHTER]
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO HIM RIGHT NOW ON THE SHOW WAAAA?
[LAUGHTER]
WAAAA, WAAAAWAAAA LINDSEY GRAHAM.
>> HE IS LOOKING AT A CHANGING POLITICAL LANDSCAPE AND I THINK
DO THAT AT THIS POINT IT'S IN ALL OF OUR INTERESTS TO INVITE HIM BACK IN AND TELL HIM HOW
IMPORTANT HIS WORK WILL BE TO SUCCESS ULTIMATELY ON THE BILL.
>> Jon: HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT CANDY OR A PACIFIER FOR SENATOR GRAHAM SO THAT HE WOULD THEN
KNOW -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LET'S TALK ABOUT SORT OF THE ELEPHANT BEHIND THE CURTAIN -- NO DISRESPECT AGAIN TO SENATOR GRAHAM.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU WERE GIVEN DOCTOR IN 2007 BY THE SUPREME COURT THE RIGHT TO LEGISLATE GREENHOUSES GASES.
>> RIGHT IT'S AN OBLIGATION BY LAW.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE NOT EXERCISED IT YET.
>> ACTUALLY WE HAVE.
WE'VE DECLARED GREENHOUSES GASES POLLUTANTS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT.
MORE IMPORTANTLY LAST MONTH WE STARTED REGULATING CARS IN THIS COUNTRY FOR THE FIRST TIME ARE
NOW REGULATED FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN ADDITION TO FUEL ECONOMY.
>> Jon: YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT JUST IN CALIFORNIA OR --
>> NATIONWIDE.
MOST PEOPLE I HOPE KNOW BY NOW CARS WILL BE CLEANER.
BY 2040 WE'LL HAVE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION LIMITS BECAUSE WE USED THE CLEAN ACT ACT TO REGULATE.
>> Jon: I COMMUTE TO WORK IN A PRIVATE JET SANDWICH.
IT'S A PRIVATE JET IN BETWEEN TWO PRIVATE JETS.
>> THAT'S A PROBLEM.
>> Jon: THAT WILL FACE SOME SCRUTINY?
>> WE HAVE NOT STARTED TO LOOK AT OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION.
SINCE YOU GIVE ME AN OPEN, I THINK THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES THERE.
THE THING ABOUT THE CARS IS EVERYONE WANTED THEM.
THE CAR MAKERS, THE UNIONS, THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS.
EVERYONE WAS HAPPY AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THE WONDERFUL DAY IN THE ROSE GARDEN.
I THINK THERE ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THAT.
>> Jon: IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE PREPARING LEGISLATIVELY.
IT SEEMS LIKE MOST PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON AGREE LEGISLATING THIS ISSUE IS A BETTER RESULT
THAN JUST REGULATING IT.
BUT IT SEEMS THEY ARE GETTING TOGETHER TO LEGISLATE THE E.P.A.'S ABILITY TO REGULATE IT.
SENATOR ROCKEFELLER IS INVOLVED IN.
OBEE FROM OHIO --
>> WISCONSIN.
>> Jon: YOU ARE GOOD.
ARE THEY GOING TO STRIP YOU OF THIS POWER BEFORE YOU EXERCISE IT AND IS THAT LIKE THE START OF
SOME SORT OF WEIRD FAIRY TALE?
>> WE'VE ALREADY EXERCISED IT.
WE'VE DONE IT PWAUSZ THE LAW SAYS WE -- BECAUSE THE LAW SAYS WE MUST DO IT.
WHAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IS IS THE DAY WE START TALKING ABOUT GETTING THERE.
IT'S THE TALK IN THE BILL WHICH MOST OF US HAVE SEEN.
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO RELEASE TODAY SPECULATION IT WOULD STRIP AUTHORITIES, WHAT WOULD THE E.P.A. DO?
I HAVE SAID TO FOLKS, WE HAVE TO GET A BILL SO WE CAN START HAVING THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW
TO BEST TO MOVE TO CLEAN ENERGY.
>> Jon: THEY DON'T SHOW YOU THE BRILLHAND?
-- BEFOREHAND.
THEY DON'T CALL YOU UP AND SAY THERE'S A LISA P. JACKSON CAN'T TALK TO US PROVISION.
>> THEY TALK TO US.
I MET WITH SENATOR KERRY.
>> Jon: OH, GOD.
WHEN YOU MEET WITH SENATOR KERRY DO YOU BLOCK OUT THE WHOLE DAY?
>> JON --
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: DOES HE SAY LET'S MEET FOR BRUNCH BECAUSE IT'S GOING
THROUGH BREAKFAST AND LUNCH.
>> HE IS PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE.
HE HAS WORKED REALLY HARD ON IT.
>> Jon: HE'S UP IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE.
IT'S DIFFICULT FOR HIM.
WE'RE DOWN HERE WITH THE CARBON.
[LAUGHTER]
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WITH THE DIFFICULTIES NOW AND THE PARTISAN POLITICS IS CAP AND
TRADE WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO WITH OR PIECEMEAL HAPPEN HAPPENSTANCE WE'RE GOING TO
REGULATE CARBON HERE.
WE'RE GOING TO REGULATE COAL HERE.
>> WHAT PASSES THE HOUSE WAY BACK WHEN WAS ECONOMY WIDE CAP AND TRADE, A MARKET PRICE ON CARBON.
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE IS OPEN TO THE IDEA THAT MAKE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS THING
THROUGH DIFFERENT LENSES.
UTILITY SECTOR SAID WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE CAP AND TRADE.
IT'S WORKING ON THE EAST COAST AND OUT WEST.
THE OIL REFINERIES SAID MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE WANT TO GO.
I THINK CERTAINLY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE CARE ABOUT A PRICE ON CARBON, A MARKET
INCENTIVE, THE PRIVATE SECTOR GETTING INVOLVED SO WE CAN MEET OUR COMMITMENTS FOR THE REST OF
THE WORLD -- FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.
>> Jon: AND MY IDEA,
OBVIOUSLY, A FORCE FIELD TO KEEP CARBON FROM OTHER COUNTRIES FROM GETTING -- LIKE THE SAME FILTER
THAT GOES IN YOUR SINK FOR THE WATER OVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
YOU THINK I'M SILLY.
>> I DON'T THINK YOU ARE SILLY AT YOU WILL.
>> Jon: I SAW YOU BLINK HELP.
YOU BLINKED HELP.
>> MORSE CODE.
>> Jon: I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU COMING BY.
WILL YOU GET THE BILL TOMORROW?
>> WE DON'T KNOW.
WE DON'T HAVE A NEW DATE.
WE'RE WAITING WITH BEAT BATED BREATH.
>> Jon: DON'T DO THAT.||||
