AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY'RE
SAYING, YOU'RE GOING TO HELL!
[APPLAUSE]
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, BOY, I GOT TO TELL YOU
THIS, AND I WANT YOU TO HEAR
THIS, THE SANCTIMONIOUS
RIGHT-WING PUNDITS ALWAYS WANT
TO FORCE THEIR VISION OF THE
WORLD ON EVERYONE ELSE.
BECAUSE THEY'RE OFFENDED, WE ALL
HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING UP.
>> THIS IS A PAIR OF STEEL BEAMS
IN THE FORM OF A CROSS FOUND IN
THE WRECKAGE OF THE WORLD TRADE
CENTER.
A GROUP OF ATHEISTS HAVE
RECENTLY FILED A LAWSUIT SAYING
THAT THIS CROSS SHOULD NOT BE
PART OF THE GROUND ZERO
MEMORIAL.
>> Jon: ATHEISTS!
[LAUGHTER]
DAMN YOU TO -- ATHEISTS.
[APPLAUSE]
BY THE WAY, ATHEISTS, WHY DO YOU
GIVE A [BLEEPED]?
THAT CROSS IS AN ARTIFACT.
IT WAS FOUND AT GROUND ZERO.
IT HAS COME TO MEAN SOMETHING TO
PEOPLE WHO VIEW IT AS A SYMBOL
OF COMFORT.
IF IT REALLY BOTHERS YOU, WHY
NOT JUST THINK OF IT AS A METAL
T-SHAPED THINGY?
OR PURELY AN ARCHITECTURAL TERM.
IT'S NOT A CROSS.
IT'S A CROSS BEAM.
DON'T THINK OF IT AS AN ODE TO
JESUS.
THINK OF IT AS AN HOMAGE TO
JESUS THE CANAANITE WITH A
RELATIVELY UNSUCCESSFUL
CARPENTRY BUSINESS.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S FINE,
THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S OUR SYSTEM.
YOU CAN FILE LAWSUITS.
JUST BECAUSE THERE IS A LAWSUIT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT WILL BE
SUCCESSFUL.
EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR
DAY IN COURT.
IT'S NOT LIKE THE ATHEISTS ARE
BEING TOTAL DICKS ABOUT IT.
>> HERE'S A QUOTE FROM DAVE
SILVERMAN, THE PRESIDENT OF THE
AMERICAN ATHEISTS ORGANIZATION.
"THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CROSS
HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN ICON.
IT HAS BEEN BLESSED BY SO-CALLED
HOLY MEN AND PRESENTED AS A
REMINDER THAT THEIR GOD, WHO
COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO STOP THE
MUSLIM TERRORISTS OR PREVENT
3,000 PEOPLE FROM BEING KILLED
IN HIS NAME, CARED ONLY ENOUGH
TO BESTOW UPON US SOME RUBBLE
THAT RESEMBLES A CROSS."
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Jon:, WELL, I CAN SEE WHY
HE'S THE PRESIDENT.
[LAUGHTER]
"AS PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN
ATHEIST ORGANIZATION, I PROMISE
TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE, EVEN
THOSE WHO ARE INDIFFERENT TO OUR
CAUSE, WILL [BLEEPED] HATE US."
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, THE ATHEISTS
SYMBOL IS THIS, THE ATOM, WHICH
THE GROUP SUGGESTED AS AN
ALTERNATIVE STATUE AT GROUND
ZERO, BECAUSE WE'RE ALL MADE OF
ATOMS.
BUT UNLESS I'M WRONG HERE, ATOMS
ARE ALREADY WELL REPRESENTED AT
GROUND ZERO.
THERE ARE BILLIONS OF THEM
THERE.
[LAUGHTER]
SO I GUESS IT ALL COMES DOWN TO
A SIZE ISSUE.
YOU'RE MAD THAT THE ATOMS ARE
MICROSCOPIC AND THE CROSS IS
BIG.
PERHAPS AS A COMPROMISE, WE
COULD BUILD YOU AN ATOMIC SYMBOL
STATUE, BUT IT HAS TO BE MADE
OUT OF BILLIONS OF CROSSES.
[LAUGHTER]
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
