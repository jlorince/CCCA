MY GUEST TONIGHT, A LAWYER AND
THE CHAIRMAN OF COMMON GOOD.
HE'S THE AUTHOR OF SEVERAL
BOOKS, HIS MOST RECENT "LIFE
WITHOUT LAWYERS."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE SHOW
PHILIP K. HOWARD.
SIR.
( APPLAUSE )
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
FIRST, LET ME SAY, I'VE BEEN
READING AND ADMIRING YOUR BOOKS
FOR MANY YEARS NOW, AND IT'S
VERY NICE TO HAVE YOU ON THE
PROGRAM.
YOU SAY THAT GOVERNMENT IS NOT
FOCUSED ENOUGH ON THE
BUREAUCRATIC PROCESSES OF
GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S WHAT'S
BEEN REALLY LEADING US ASTRAY.
>> RIGHT.
NO ONE CAN MAKE CHOICES.
THERE'S SO MUCH BUREAUCRACY.
AND I SAID AT ANY LEVEL OF
RESPONSIBILITY, THE PRESIDENT,
THE SCHOOLTEACHER, THEY'RE NOT
ALLOWED TO USE THEIR BEST
JUDGMENT.
SO NOTHING HAPPENS SENSIBLY.
>> Jon: HAS BEST JUDGMENT BEEN
REMOVED BECAUSE OF... ARE WE
INCOMPETENT?
DO WE NO LONGER HAVE JUDGMENT?
IF YOU LET US HAVE JUDGMENT,
WOULD WE WALK INTO WALLS?
WHAT WOUND HAPPEN TO US?
ALL WE ARE ALL MR. MAGOOS NOW?
>> YES.
>> Jon: YES?
>> NO.
IT'S THIS IDEA THAT LECH CENTRAL
PLANNING.
YOU CAN TELL EVERYBODY HOW TO DO
THE JOB, THE TEACHER HOW TO DO
THE JOB AND FILL OUT TEN FORMS,
TELL HER HOW SHE'S TEACHING THE
CLASS, SHE'LL TEACH A BETTER
CLASS.
IF THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE HIS
PEOPLE GO THROUGH TEN YEARS OF
REVIEW FOR AN ENVIRONMENTALLY
IMPORTANT PROJECT, THEN IT WILL
BE PERFECT.
UNFORTUNATELY THE ENVIRONMENT
WILL BE RUINED BY THE TIME THEY
PUT A SHOVEL IN THE GROUND.
IT'S THAT PROBLEM IN LIFE.
NO ONE CAN SAY GO.
NO ONE CAN ACTUALLY JUST
>> Jon: WE'VE TAKEN AN
IMPORTANT ROLE OF GOVERNMENT AND
NEUTERED IT TO SOME EXTENT.
>> WE'VE MADE IT FAIL.
WE'VE MADE IT FAIL BY BASICALLY
SHACKLING EVERYONE AT EVERY
LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT.
IT ENDS UP SHACKLING EVERYONE IN
SOCIETY, AS WELL.
NO ONE CAN USE THEIR COMMON
SENSE.
EVERYONE HAS THEIR NOSE IN A
RULE BOOK AS IF LAW WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO SET GOALS AND
BOUNDARIES.
PEOPLE HAVE TO BE FREE TO
ACTUALLY MAKE CHOICES THAT
BALANCE DIFFERENT PUBLIC GOALS,
FOR EXAMPLE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY TWO
CHOICES WE ARE ALLOWED TO MAKE
OR WE'RE BEING TOLD TO MAKE IS
WE CAN EITHER BE COME --
COMPLETELY FREE OR WE MUST BE
RUN BY AN INCOMPETENT,
BRAZIL-LIKE DEMOCRACY.
WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING, I DON'T
RECALL US HAVING THAT CHOICE.
WHAT YOU SAID, THE EFFICIENT
THING, I LIKE THAT.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THAT HARD.
IF YOU LOOK AT A GOOD CHARTER
SCHOOL, PEOPLE MAKE JUDGMENTS.
THERE ARE ACTUALLY AGENCIES FROM
TIME TO TIME WHERE PEOPLE
ACTUALLY MAKE JUDGMENTS.
MAYOR BLOOMBERG...
>> Jon: THE MINUTE YOU SAY
CHARTER SCHOOL, EVERYONE SAYS,
YOU'RE DESTROYING PUBLIC SCHOOLS
OR ALL THESE OTHER THINGS.
WE CAN'T EVEN HAVE THIS
CONVERSATION IT APPEARS.
>> RIGHT.
WE CAN'T IN THE CURRENT
POLITICAL SYSTEM BECAUSE THE
CURRENT POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS
ALMOST A CONSPIRACY TO ARGUE
ABOUT THINGS THAT AREN'T
RELEVANT.
WHEREAS WHAT'S RELEVANT IS HOW
YOU BUILD THE NEW POWER LINE,
YOU KNOW, HOW YOU ACTUALLY
BALANCE DIFFERENT PUBLIC NEEDS
SO WE CAN BALANCE THE BUDGET.
>> Jon: WHAT YOU JUST SAID
THERE MADE ME WANT TO HUG YOU.
( LAUGHTER )
>> I WANT TO HUG YOU, TOO.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S VERY NICE.
HAVE WE GOTTEN SO GOOD AT
POLITICS THAT WE'VE FORGOTTEN
HOW TO BE GOOD AT GOVERNANCE?
>> COMPLETELY.
AND ALL THE POLITICAL LEADERS,
MANY OF WHOM ARE ON THE BOARD OF
THIS ORGANIZATION I RUN, LIKE
HOWARD BAKER AND BILL BRADLEY,
WILL SAY THAT.
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS WE'VE
COMPLETELY LOST SIGHT OF THE
COMMON GOOD PLAYING THIS
PARTISAN GAME AND NO ONE IS ABLE
TO MAKE THESE CHOICES.
YOU KNOW, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A
TIME WHEN GOVERNMENT WAS MORE
IMPORTANT.
WE LIVE IN AN ANONYMOUS,
INTERDEPENDENT WORLD.
I DON'T KNOW WHO PUT THE PAINT
ON THE TOYS THAT MY GRAND CHILD
IS PLAYING WITH.
>> Jon: THAT WAS MEMENT I
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
>> SO WE NEED GOVERNMENT AND WE
NEED IT TO BE FUNCTIONAL.
THE TEA PARTY IS RIGHT.
IT IS IDIOTIC.
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T
NEED GOVERNMENT.
WE MEADE IT TO BE HUMAN.
>> Jon: AND NIMBLE ANDAGE
I'LL.
WE DON'T HAVE A TON OF TIME.
I'M GOING TO THROW TO
COMMERCIAL.
CAN YOU STAY FOR ANOTHER FIVE
MINUTES AND TALK US TO ON THE
WEB?
PHILIP K. HOWARD.
PLEASE GET SOME OF HIS B
