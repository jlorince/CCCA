>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY.
WEWELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOOD PROGRAM TONIGHT.
AN AMAZING PROGRAM.
GOING TO BE INTERVIEWING TWO GUESTS, COAUTHORS OF BOOK ENTITLED "IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN
IT LOOKS." IT'S A BOOK ABOUT THIS THING ON MY BACK.
NO.
BEFORE WE GET THE SHOW STARTED I DO WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.
TELL ME YOU KNOW THIS.
FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS OR SO,
I'VE BEEN A FAN OF THE NEW YORK METS ORGANIZATION.
FOR THAT ENTIRE 50 YEARS THE METS AND I HAVE HAD ONE THING IN COMMON.
NEITHER OF US HAD EVER THRONE A NO-HITTER.
THAT ALL CHANGED ON FRIDAY NIGHT.
I WAS THERE BECAUSE I AM A COTTON CANDY VENDOR.
YOU MAY HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN IT ON SPORTS CENTER.
YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE METS' FIRST NO-HITTER IN THEIR EXISTENCE FROM MY VANTAGE POINT.
THIS IS MY EYE REPORT.
I FILMED THIS.
THIS IS THE LAST PITCH.
EVERYBODY IS GOING CRAZY.
THE PLAYERS START RUNNING ON THE FIELD.
ALL THAT.
INCREDIBLE TO BE THERE.
FOR ME THE GREATEST PART WAS I WAS ABLE TO SHARE IT WITH MY FAMILY.
MY CHILDREN WERE THERE.
THEY I THINK REALLY APPRECIATED A NIGHT OF HOT DOGS, ICE CREAM,
POPCORN, MORE ICE CREAM, AND THEN BEING ROBUSTLY SHAKEN.
(LAUGHING ).
BOTH OF MY KIDS JUST DID THIS.
THEY HAD EATEN SO MUCH.
ALL I WAS DOING WAS SHAKING THEM AROUND.
THEY BOTH DID THIS.
WHAT A GREAT... BUT I SUFFERED MUCH FOR THESE METS OVER MY LIFE WHICH IS WHY THESE MOMENTS OF
JOY THAT OCCUR SPORADICALLY ARE EVEN MORE APPRECIATED.
THIS MET TEAM IS A FUN TEAM.
THEY'RE A SCRAPPY TEAM.
THEY PLAY THE GAME RIGHT.
THESE 2012 METS.
I GIVE YOU FOR ANYBODY WHO WONDERS AT HOME WHAT THE FACE OF A TRUE METS' FAN AT THE END OF
THE FIRST NO-HITTER OF THE NEW YORK METS' EXISTENCE LOOKED LIKE.
(LAUGHING ).
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) .
ALL RIGHT.
THERE WE GO.
ANYWAY, NOW IF ANYBODY WAS WONDERING I
