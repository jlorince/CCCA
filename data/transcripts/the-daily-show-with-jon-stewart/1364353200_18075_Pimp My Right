WE'LL LET YOU KNOW IF THEY FIND ONE!
OH, OH, WHO WANTS A PIECE OF THIS?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHO WANTS A PIECE OF THIS?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

LAST WEEK THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE RELEASED ITS REPORT ON WHAT WENT WRONG IN THE
2012 ELECTION AND HOW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CAN REVERSE ITS FORTUNES IN THE FUTURE.
>> OFFICIALS ARE CALLING IT AN AUTOPSY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY ARE CALLING IT AN AUTOPSY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: IT IS A DOCUMENT OF IDEALISTIC NAMED FOR BODIES IN THE RIVER.
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE RUB A LITTLE CANCER UNDER OUR NOSES AND GET TO THE BUSINESS OF CUTTING THIS
BLOATED CORPSE OPEN.
WE KNOW THE TIME OF DEATH.
RNCRINCE PREEBOUS WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF DEATH?
>> THE MESSAGE ISN'T RESONATING ENOUGH.
IT GOES BACK TO WHAT OUR MOMS USED TO TELL US, IT'S NOT JUST WHAT YOU SAY IT'S HOW WE SAY IT.
>> Jon: FOR INSTANCE,, THE WAY I SAY IT IS LIKE A DRUNK MUPPET.
OR AS DRUNK MUPPETS ARE KNOWN TO THE POLICE DRUPPETS.
A 100 PAGE REPORT TO REASSURE REPUBLICANS THEY DON'T NEED TO CHANGE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING BUT
HOW THEY ARE SAYING IT.
REMEMBER, WHEN YOU TELL A GAY PERSON THAT THEIR LOVE IS TOO UNNATURAL FOR SOCIETY TO
RECOGNIZE --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- SMILE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
A BIG ISSUE FOR 2012 WAS TO CONNECT WITH MINORITIES.
PLEASE WELCOME G.O.P. 2.0 RELATABLE STYLE.
>> WE'RE GOING TO OVERALL OUR CAMPAIGN MECHANIC STRUCTURE TO FULLY INTEGRATE THE DEMOGRAPHIC
ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY.
THIS NEW APPROACH WILL BE DIVERSE, YEAR-ROUND, COMMUNITY-BASED AND DEDICATED TO
PERSON-TO-PERSON ENGAGEMENT.
WE'LL CONDUCT A PILOT PROGRAM AND TARGETED URBAN MARKETS TO TESTED AND RE-- TO TEST AND
REFINE THE ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THE LOCAL NATIVES SEEM TO BE FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE WITH MY PRESENCE.
HOLY (bleep).
LET ME BRAKE THIS STRATEGY DOWN, IF I MAY.
AFTER PRETENDING -- SETTLE DOWN.
SETTLE DOWN IT'S A PUN.
LET ME BREAK THIS STRATEGY DOWN.
AFTER PRETENDING MINORITIES DIDN'T EXIST THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS DECIDED TO PHYSICALLY
GO INTO THE AREAS AND ENGAGE PERSON-TO-PERSON OR AS THAT IS KNOWN ON THE STREETS, TALKING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT OF COURSE AS THE SAYING GOES, TALK IS NOT CHEAP.
>> WE'RE GOING TO BE ANNOUNCING A $10 MILLION INITIATIVE JUST THIS YEAR IN WHICH IT WILL
INCLUDE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, PAID, ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM COAST TO COAST, IN HISPANIC,
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ASIAN COMMUNITIES TALKING ABOUT OUR PARTY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WE WERE JUST GOING TO PAY $5 MILLION BUT THESE ARE MINORITY COMMUNITIES SO WE HAD
TO SWEETEN THE POT.
YOU UNDERSTAND.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE YOU GO YOU'LL GO TO MINORITY NEIGHBORHOODS, COULD MARKET RESEARCH AND TAKE PEOPLE
BACK TO THE MINORITY COMMUNITIES WITH A RETARGETED MESSAGE.
IT WORKS FOR COOL CIGARETTES.
WHY NOT FOR ANOTHER ORGANIZATI
