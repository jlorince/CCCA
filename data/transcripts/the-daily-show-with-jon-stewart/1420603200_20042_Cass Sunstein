>> Jon:  WELCOME BACK, MYGUEST TONIGHT A PROFESSOR AT THE
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL THERE, ALSO ALEGAL SCHOLAR.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "WISER: GETTING BEYOND GROUP THINK TO
MAKE GROUPS SMARTER."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM,CASS SUNSTEIN. SIR! YOUNG MAN.
>> THANK YOU, SIR. THANK YOU,SIR.
>> Jon: PLEASE. COME. SIT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANKS FORHAVING ME.
>> Jon: MY FIRST QUESTION ISTHIS -- THIS IS BLURRY, RIGHT?
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BLURRY?
>> YEAH, THAT'S INTENTIONAL. SOYOU FOCUS.
>> Jon: OH, THANK GOD. ALLRIGHT, BECAUSE I THOUGHT,
OKAY, I AM OLD,BUT I AM NOT THAT OLD.
GROUP THINK, NOW, YOU'VE WORKEDA LOT ON GOVERNMENT REGULATION,
ON SMARTER GOVERNMENT.
GROUP THINK IS A SEPARATEENTITY, A SEPARATE ISSUE FROM
THAT.
BUT YOU HAVE THIS FASCINATINGSTUDY IN HERE ABOUT THESE GROUPS
IN COLORADO, ONE IN BOULDER,ONE IN COLORADO SPRINGS.
>> RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENED IS WEGOT A BUNCH OF LIBERALS IN
BOULDER TO TALK ABOUT CLIMATECHANGE, SAME-SEX RELATIONS AND
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.>> Jon: YES.
>> JUST THE LIBERALS TOGETHERAND HAD THEM TALK TO EACH OTHER.
AND AS THEY TALKED, THEY GOTMORE AND MORE TO THE LEFT.
WE DID THE SAME THING INCOLORADO SPRINGS.
WE GOT CONSERVATIVES, PEOPLE WHOTEND TO LIKE VICE PRESIDENT
CHENEY -->> Jon: YES.
>> TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUTEXACTLY THE SAME ISSUES, AND AS
THEY TALKED, THEY GOT MORE ANDMORE TO THE RIGHT.
SO WHAT HAPPENED IS BEFORE THELIKEMINDED --
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU GET MORE TOTHE RIGHT OF DICK CHENEY?
( LAUGHTER ).
>> WELL WE DIDN'T ASK THEM "AREYOU TO THE RIGHT OF
DICK CHENEY?" WEASKED THEM, "WHAT
DO YOU THINK ABOUT CLIMATECHANGE?"
>> Jon: I SEE. I SEE.>> AND SAME SEX MARRIAGE.
AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS BEFORETHEY STARTED TO TALK IN GROUPS
OF LIKE-MINDED TYPES, THEY COULDDEAL.
THEY COULD TALK TO EACHOTHER.
BUT WHEN THE COLORADO SPRINGSPEOPLE TALKED ONLY TO THE
COLORADO SPRINGS PEOPLE, ANDWHEN THE BOULDER PEOPLE TALKED
TO ONLY THE BOULDER PEOPLE, ITWAS IT AS IF THEY WERE LIVING IN
TWO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.
>> Jon: AND HOW -- SO, WHEN YOUPUT THESE IDEOLOGICAL GROUPS,
WHEN THEY FIRST GOTTOGETHER, THEY WERE NOT
STRIDENTLY IDEOLOGICAL?
THEY WERE NOT DOGMATIC?
BUT THEY BECAME THAT WAY?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY WERE DIVERSE. SO JUSTLIKE IN ANY TOWN THAT TENDS
CONSERVATIVE OR THAT TENDSLIBERAL,
YOU'LL HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO AREFAR RIGHT, SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE
FAR LEFT.
THEY WON'T ALL BE EXTREME.WHAT HAPPENED WAS A SHORT
DISCUSSION OF THESE THREEISSUES --
>> Jon: WITH EACH OTHER.
>> WITH EACH OTHER MADE THECONSERVATIVES MUCH MORE
CONSERVATIVE, MADE THE LIBERALSMUCH MORE LIBERAL.
>> Jon:  SO IS THE LESSONHERE TO NOT HAVE CONGRESS CAUCUS
WITH EACH OTHER?
>> I THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLYBE A LITTLE TOO STRONG, BUT I
THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA FORPEOPLE WHO ARE TALKING JUST TO
LIKE-MINDED ARE OTHERSTO THINK TO THEMSELVES
THE INFORMATION WE'RE GETTINGFOR EACH OTHER MAYBE ISN'T
THE FULL UNIVERSE OFINFORMATION THERE IS.
SO IF YOU GET STIRRED UP THATCLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX OR SOME
GROUP OF PEOPLE IS TERRIBLEBECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE
RIGHT RELIGION OR SOMETHING.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT MAY WELL BE THAT WHAT'SHAPPENING IS THAT THERE'S A
LITTLE ECHO CHAMBER.
>> Jon:  IS IT THAT THEY ALLGO TO THE RIGHT OF THE MOST
IDEOLOGICAL INDIVIDUAL OF THEGROUP?
IS IT-- DOES IT ONLY WORK THATWAY IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE
GROUP THAT IS A TENT POSTDOGMATIC INDIVIDUAL THAT DRIVES
PEOPLE OVER THERE?
OR NO MATTER WHAT, IT GOES INTHAT DIRECTION?
>> THERE IS SOME VARIETY, ANDTHEY DON'T ALWAYS GO TO THE MOST
EXTREME.
IT'S JUST THAT THE MEDIAN AFTERTHEY TALK TO EACH OTHER IS MORE
EXTREME THAN THE MEDIAN BEFORETHEY TALKED TO EACH OTHER.
>> Jon: DOES THIS WORK WITHANYTHING?
DOES THIS WORK WITH RELIGION?
IF YOU PUT FIVE REFORMED JEWS INA ROOM, DO THEY COME OUT WITH
PEYOS? LIKE HOW, HOW DOES THAT,YOU KNOW, HOW DOES THAT,
HOW DOES THAT WORK?
AND HOW DO YOU MITIGATE THAT?
I GUESS THEY WOULD CALL THATEPISTEMIC CLOSURE.
>> YEAH. WELL, WE HAVEN'T DONEIT WITH THE IN THE CASE YOU'RE
DESCRIBING SO I DON'T KNOW THERESULT OF THAT ONE --
>> Jon: YOU, YOU CAN SAY THEWORD "JEW."
IT'S NOT A -- YOU KNOW. YEAH.
( LAUGHTER )>> BUT IT IS THE CASE THAT THIS
IS A REGULARITY. IT'S BEEN FOUNDIN A DOZEN COUNTRIES OR MORE.
IT HAPPENS AMONG PEOPLE INFRANCE WHO ARE SUSPICIOUS OF THE
UNITED STATES AFTER THEY TALK TOEACH OTHER, THEY GET A LOT MORE
SUSPICIOUS.
PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED ABOUTBEHAVIOR IN THE WORKFORCE.
IF THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER, THEYGET MORE OUTRAGED.
THE BEST WAY TO STOP IT FROMHAPPENING BY THE WAY --
>> Jon: YEAH.>> IS EITHER TO USE DATA AND
EVIDENCE AND TO KIND OFINSERT THAT IN OR TO MAKE SURE
PEOPLE AREN'T JUST TALKING TOLIKE-MINDED TYPES.
>> Jon: NOW I HAVE SEEN,THOUGH, THAT PEOPLE HAVE STUDIED
WHEN YOU INTRODUCE DATA ANDEVIDENCE IT ALMOST HARDENS THE
IDEOLOGICAL OR THE DOGMATICINDIVIDUAL.
ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW, THEY TALKABOUT THINGS LIKE CLIMATE
CHANGE, YOU CAN BRING IN PEOPLEWHO ARE SKEPTICAL OF IT.
THE MINUTE YOU INTRODUCE DATA,OR VACCINES, THEY HARDEN IN
THEIR POSITION AND REFUSETO ADDRESS IT.
>> YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT.
SO IF WE HAVE AN ISSUE THAT ISIDEOLOGICALLY VERY INFLAMED,
ONCE PEOPLE HEAR DATA THATCONFLICTS WITH WHAT THEY ALREADY
THOUGHT, THEY EITHER GET THEY'REBACK UP AND START REACTING,
"THAT HAS TO BE WRONG BECAUSEIT'S DISTURBING MY DEEPEST
BELIEF."
OR THEY THINK, "WHY WOULD THEYDENY MY BELIEF IF I WEREN'T
RIGHT?">> Jon:  SO PEOPLE ARE THE
WORST.
( LAUGHTER )WE'RE THE WORST.
>> WELL -->> Jon: SO HOW DO YOU--
THIS SEEMS LIKE -- SOBASICALLY, ALMOST WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS IT IS HUMANNATURE TO HARDEN YOUR POSITION
WHEN YOU SURROUND YOURSELF BYLIKE-MINDED PEOPLE, BUT PEOPLE
ARE DRAWN TO LIKE-MINDEDINDIVIDUALS.
SO THIS SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OFPERPETUAL EMOTION MACHINE.
>> OKAY, HERE'S A STORY FROM THEFOUNDING OF THE CONSTITUTION.
>> Jon: WELL, I LOVE A NICESTORY.
>> THIS IS, WHEN THECONSTITUTION WAS STARTED THERE
WAS A PROPOSAL TO HAVE AS OURFIRST AMENDMENT, SOMETHING WHICH
WOULD GIVE CONSTITUENTS THERIGHT TO INSTRUCT THEIR
REPRESENTATIVES, AND THATCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WAS
DEFEATED ON THE GROUNDARTICULATED BY THE EARLY
GENERATION THAT WE WANT DIVERSEPEOPLE IN OUR CONGRESS WHO ARE
TALKING TO EACH OTHER ANDLEARNING FROM ONE ANOTHER, AND
THE RIGHT TO INSTRUCT WOULD
DEFEAT THE POINT OF THEMEETING.
SO I THINK THAT'S A PROFOUNDLESSON ABOUT HOW IF YOU ARE
THINKING THAT YOUR JOB IS TOLISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE
DIFFERENT FROM YOURSELF -->> Jon: YEAH.
>> THEN YOU CAN BREAK THISLITTLE
AMPLIFICATION MACHINE WE'REDESCRIBING.
AND WE'VE SEEN IT IN AMERICANHISTORY.
IN THE MOVEMENT FOR SEXEQUALITY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE
ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT, WHEREPRESIDENT NIXON WAS ACTUALLY A
HERO.
AND PRESIDENT REAGAN WAS THEARCHITECT REALLY OF THE MONTREAL
PROTOCOL, WHICH PRESERVED THEOZONE LAYER.
THAT WAS DATA DRIVEN ANDGETTING DIVERSE PEOPLE IN THE
ROOM.
>> Jon:  YOU NEED ONE REBELIN THE GROUP.
YOU NEED SOMEBODY WHO HASDOGMATIC CREDIBILITY,
IDEOLOGICAL CREDIBILITY, BUT WHOWILL STAND ON A PRINCIPLE BEYOND
THEM.
IS THAT THE WAY TO BREAK THESPELL? THE HEX?
>> THAT'S ONE WAY.
DATA CAN WORK IF PEOPLE AREN'TIDEOLOGICALLY REALLY INVESTED.
BUT IF THERE'S AN ISOLATEDDISSENTER, SOMETIMES THAT CAN
REDUCE CONFORMITY PRESSURES ANDGET GROUP THINK DEFEATED.
>> Jon: OR WE JUST KEEPPEOPLE APART.
THAT'S THE OTHER THING.
YOU KEEP PEOPLE APART.
YOU DON'T LET PEOPLE GATHER.
THEY LIVE IN PODS.
PEOPLE LIVE IN PODS AND ARE FEDTHROUGH A TUBE.
YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA THINK,CASS.
SOLUTIONS, MYFRIEND.
"WISER" IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVESNOW.
READ IT ALONE. CASS SUNSTEIN.
