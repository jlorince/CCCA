>> WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW",
MY SAME IN JON STEWART.
THE ALWAYS DELIGHTFUL DAVID
SEDARIS IS HERE.
HE'S IN MY TOP, I WOULD SAY MY
TOP TWO FAVORITE SEDARISS OF ALL
TIME.
DAVID AND AMY TOP TWO.
DROPS OFF SEDARI I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE PLURAL IS.
THERE'S A GRAND TRADITION IN THE
GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS.
EACH PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST SHOULD
BE FOLLOWED BY A THOREAU AND
ROBUST CONGRESSIONAL REFERENDUM
AND IN SUCH INSTANCE WHEREUPON
THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY RECEIVES
UNTO IT A FLIPPING OF ASS THE
PRESIDENT SHALL THEN IN DUE
HASTE PRESENT FORTH AN
OBLIGATORY POST ELECTORAL RED
CARPETED PODIUMED WALK OF SHAME
SO IT IS WRITTEN SO SAY WE ALL.
>> AFTER WHAT I'M SURE WAS A
LONG NIGHT FOR A LOT OF YOU, AND
NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT WAS FOR ME,
I CAN TELL THAT YOU, YOU KNOW,
SOME ELECTION NIGHTS ARE MORE
FUN THAN OTHERS.
>> Jon: LIKE I REMEMBER THIS
ONE TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I WON.
IT WAS AWESOME.
[LAUGHTER]
THERE WERE BALLOONS AND THEY HAD
A BIG FLAG TAKEN AX REITAN
FRANKLIN WORE THIS CRAZY HAT.
WAS IT A BIRD?
[LAUGHTER]
GO ON.
>> PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED.
THEY ARE DEEPLY FRUSTRATED OVER
THE LAST FEW MONTHS, I'VE HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL AROUND
THE COUNTRY AND MEET PEOPLE
WHERE THEY LIVE AND WHERE THEY
WORK.
FROM BACKYARDS TO FACTORY FLOORS
I DID SOME TALKING BUT MOSTLY I
DID A LOT OF LISTENING.
>> DID YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE
THINK I'M MUSE LICK.
THEY ARE CRAZY OUT THERE.
>> THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SENT US
HERE DON'T EXPECT WASHINGTON TO
SOLVE ALL THEIR PROBLEMS BUT
THEY DO EXPECT WASHINGTON TO
WORK FOR THEM NOT AGAINST THEM.
>> DO I HAVE --
>> Jon: SO I HAVE DECIDED AND
ANNOUNCED TO MY STAFF THAT I
WILL NO LONGER WORK AGAINST THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU GOT ME!
[LAUGHTER]
MESSAGE RECEIVED.
SO A LEADER HUMBLED ANT PRESS
CORPS AT THE READY TO PLUM THE
LESSONS LEARNED FROM A DARK AND
DIFFICULT ELECTORAL REBUKE.
>> WONDERING THAT YOU BELIEVE
THE HEALTH CARE REFORM YOU
WORKED SO HARD ON IS IN DANGER
AT THIS POINT.
>> DO YOU ACCEPT THE FACT THAT
ANY KIND OF SPENDING TO CREATE
JOBS IS DEAD AT THIS POINT?
>> IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE
A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHO
THINK YOUR POLICIES ARE TAKING
US IN REVERSE?
>> ARE YOU WILLING TO MAKE
CHANGES IN YOUR LEADERSHIP
STYLE?
>> WHO YOU DO YOU THINK SPEAKS
TO THE TRUE VOICE OF AMERICAN
PEOPLE RIGHT NOW YOU OR JOHN
BOEHNER.
>> Jon: MR. PRESIDENT, TODD
PATERSON, DO YOU SUCK AND A
QUICK FOLLOW-UP DO YOU SUCH SO
BAD YOU DON'T KNOW HOW SUCKY YOU
ARE.
I WOULD LIKE THE ANSWER, IF YOU
WOULD, IN THE FORM OF YOU SUCK!
[LAUGHTER]
BUT OF COURSE THE KEY TO ANY
PRESIDENTIAL PRESIDENT
CONFERENCE IS NOT THE QUESTION
AND ANSWER SESSION BUT THE
INTANGIBLES.
LET'S GO TO THE ANALYSIS.
>> IT WAS LAME.
IT WAS VANILLA.
>> HE SEEMED GLUM AND DEPRESSED.
>>  *EFS ANNOYED.
HE LOOKED SHELL SHOCKED.
HE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A MAN ON HIS
GAME.
>> HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS PASSING
A GALLSTONE YNCH NOT BE SHIEWM
RUSS.
>> HE BREAKS YOU ICE.
>> HE SAID OKAY GOD DIDN'T GIVE
ME BIG EARS FOR NOTHING, I HEARD
YA.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: MRS. PARKER SPITZER IS
RIGHT.
OBAMA COULD HAVE BEEN LIKE I'VE
GOT BIG EARS BUT I'M NOT D MURKS
BO.
I GET IT.
HE COULD HAVE DONE A WHOLE BUNCH
OF JOKES LIKE WHITE PRESIDENTS
TAKE IT LIKE THIS:  I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU REBUKED MY POLICY
BUT BLACK PRESIDENTS TAKE IT
LIKE, OH, NO YOU DID NOT REBUKE
MY POLICY.
NO YOU DIDNT.
WHAT?
THE PRESS CONFERENCE WAS AN HOUR
LONG.
THAT'S REALLY LONG GIVE ME
SOMETHING I CAN USE.
GIVE ME SOMETHING CAN I POP INTO
THE MICROWAVE AND EAT ON THE WAY
TO THE OVEN WHERE MY OTHER FOOD
IS PREPARED.
>> IF YOU ARE NOT REFLECTING ON
YOUR POLICY AGENDA IS IT
POSSIBLE VOTERS CAN CONCLUDE YOU
ARE STILL NOT GETTING IT?
>> Jon: GETTING IT?
WHAT IS IS IT?
ISN'T IT JUST A SUBSTITUTE
GENERIC FOR WHATEVER YOU PROJECT
ON IT?
AS PRONOUNCES GO IT -- IT WON'T
EVEN CHOOSE A SEX.
I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION IS IS
IT CONTAGIOUS?
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF AMERICANS
OUT THERE WHO THINK THE
PRESIDENT DOESN'T GET IT.
>> DOES HE GET IT?
DO YOU THINK HE GETS IT?
>> HE DIDN'T GET IT TODAY.
>> NOT ONLY DID THE POLITICS NOT
GET IT?
THE VOTERS DIDN'T GET IT EITHER?
>> SOME SAY HE THINKS YOU DON'T
GET IT.
>> HE DOESN'T GET IT.
>> DOES HE GET IT?
>> EVEN IF HE DOESN'T GET IT HE
NEEDS TO ACT AS IF HE DOES.
>> ARE YOU SUGGESTING THE
PRESIDENT FAKE IT?
[LAUGHTER]
WAIT UNLESS -- IS IT ORGASIMS?
FOR MORE WE TURN TO THE MOST
POPULAR SEGMENT OPINION DOME.
FOUR PUNDITS ENTER AND LEAVE
WHEN IT'S DONE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
JASON JONES.
WYATT CENAC, JOHN JOHN OLIVER, JASON,
WHAT DO YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THE
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH?
>> HE DOESN'T GET IT, JON.
>> Jon: WYATT CENAC?
>> IF THIS IS IT AND THIS IS THE
PRESIDENT?
>> THAT'S RIGHT, JON, BUT THE
PRESIDENT GETS SOME OF IT JUST
NOT ALL OF IT.
WHAT HE GETS IS -- E --
>> Jon: WHAT IS IT AND WERE
THERE AT LEAST MOMENTS OF IT?
>> LET START AT THE TOP.
CHECK THIS OUT.
THE WAY HE'S WALKING HERE.
THE WAY HE'S STEPPING UP TO THE
MICROPHONE HERE.
STOP THE TAPE.
STOP THE TAPE RIGHT THERE.
DO YOU SEE IT?
I DIDN'T SEE IT.
IT'S A CRUCIAL MOMENT WHERE HE
NEEDS
NEEDS TO SHOW SOME FIGHT.
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE STROLLED IN.
HE SHOULD HAVE ROLLED IN ON
THOSE SPEAKERS WITH THE WHEELS
AND THE BLINKING LIGHTS ON THEM.
THAT'S WHAT REAGAN DID IN 1982
WHY?
BECAUSE ID IT.
>> YES AND HE ALSO HAD
TREMENDOUS BALANCE, JON.
LOOK TO HISTORY WHEN TAFT
SUFFERED A MID TERM DEFEAT IN
1911 DID HE DRAG HIS ASS TO THE
PODIUM LIKE A KID GOING TO THE
DENTIST?
>> NO TAFT WAS ONE (bleep).
>> EXACTLY.
THANK YOU.
OF COURSE HE DIDN'T.
HE ROLLED HIMSELF DOWN THE
CARPET, KNOCKED OVER THE PODIUM
LEAPT UP AND SAID DON'T WORRY
AMERICA, I GET IT.
>> TAFT WASN'T FIT.
THOSE WERE LAYERS OF IT.
>> YES.
>> Jon: WHAT ABOUT THE SPEECH?
DID THAT CONNECT IN ANY WAY?
DID ANYONE?
>> LET'S HAVE A LISTEN?
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY.
>> STOP IT RIGHT THERE!
ABSOLUTE DISASTER.
HE DIDN'T HAVE IT.
WHERE WAS IT?
WASN'T THERE.
I TURNED IT OFF.
>> YOU DIDN'T WATCH THE ACTUAL
SPEECH.
>> I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT
KIND OF IT.
>> Jon: WYATT, DID YOU?
>> NO I WAS WAITING FOR LI'L
