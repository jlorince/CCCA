>> Jon: BUT YOU KNOW, WEGOT INTO THIS PICKLE FROM
AN ILL-THOUGHT OUTHYPOTHETICAL STATEMENT, A
RED LINE, SO PERHAPS THE ONLYWAY OUT IS WITH AN EQUAL AND
OPPOSITE ILL-THOUGHT OUTHYPOTHETICAL STATEMENT,
ACCORDING TO NEWTON'S THEORY OFRELATIVE STUPIDITY.
BUT WHAT KIND OFAMAGOO-ESQUE ACCIDENTAL
GENIUS COULDBUMBLE [BLEEP] THEIR WAY INTO
DIPLOMATIC SUCCESS --HELLO, IT'S JOHN KERRY TO
THE RESCUE.
SECRETARY KERRY.
[APPLAUSE]>> Jon: IN THE MIDDLE.
IN THE MIDDLE OFPRESENTING KERRY'S
SLAM-DUNK CASE AS TO WHYWE ABSOLUTELY MUST ATTACK
SYRIA, HE INADVERTENTLYMAY HAVE FOUND AN
INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTABLEPEACEFUL RESOLUTION.
>> IS THERE ANYTHING ATTHIS POINTS THAT HIS
GOVERNMENT COULD DO OROFFER THAT WOULD STOP AN
ATTACK?
>> SURE.
HE COULD TURN OVER EVERYSINGLE BIT OF HIS CHEMICAL
WEAPONS TO THEINTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN
THE NEXT WEEK.
TURN IT OVER, ALL OF IT.
WITHOUT DELAY.
AND ALLOW A FULL AND TOTALACCOUNTING FOR THAT.
BUT HE ISN'T ABOUT TO DOIT, IT CAN'T BE DONE,
OBVIOUSLY.
>> Jon: CAN'T BE DONE!
CAN'T!
IT'S NEVER GOING TOHAPPEN!
NO WAY.
CAN'T BE DONE!
AND JUST TO DRIVE THEPOINT HOME AS TO HOW
RIDICULOUS THISPOSSIBILITY WAS, THE STATE
DEPARTMENT QUICKLY CALLEDTHAT A RHETORICAL
ARGUMENT, AND NOT A REALPROPOSAL FROM KERRY.
THEY HAD TO MAKE ASEPARATE ANNOUNCEMENT TO
SAY, HEY, BY THE WAY, HEWAS JUST BEING
CONDESCENDING ANDSARCASTIC.
GUESS WHICH MIDDLE EASTERNDESPOT DOESN'T APPEAR
TO UNDERSTAND RHETORICALANSWERS.
>> SYRIA'S FOREIGN MINISTERSAYS THE COUNTRY,
QUOTE,"WELCOMES A PROPOSAL TOPUT ITS CHEMICAL WEAPONS
UNDER INTERNATIONALCONTROL."
>> Jon: MAGOO, YOU'VEDONE IT AGAIN.
>> EXCUSE ME, YOUNG MAN.
>> Jon: OH, (bleep).
SYRIA IS TAKING HIM UP ONHIS DICKISH OFFER.
SYRIA, THROUGH THE AUSPICESOF VLADIMIR PUTIN'S
RUSSIA, WOULD LIKE TO TAKETHE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY'S AND SECRETARYKERRY'S OFFER TO TAKE
THEIR WEAPONS FOR THEM.
NO WAR, NO COST, NO BLOWBACK.
HOW COULD ANY PATRIOT VIEWTHIS BUT ANYTHING BUT A
FANTASTIC DEVELOPMENT.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA HASJUST LED US INTO A
HUMILIATING DEFEAT.
>> Jon: WHO DO WE LOSETO?
SANITY?
YOU BEAT US THIS TIME,RATIONAL FORETHOUGHT, BUT
WE'LL GET YOU.
WHO CARES HOW WE AVOIDED AWAR AND GOT A DICTATOR TO
GIVE UP HIS CHEMICALWEAPONS, IF WE AVOIDED A
WAR AND GOT A DICTATOR TOGIVE UP HIS CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.
>> THIS STRENGTHENS RUSSIAAND HUMILIATES THE UNITED
STATES. >> VLADIMIR PUTIN HASFILLED THE LEADERSHIP GAP.
>> I THINK LINDSAY GRAHAMIS ON THE TAPE SAYING THAT
THE RUSSIANS HAVE PLAYEDUS LIKE A FIDDLE.
>> THEY'RE THE NEW TOP OF THEWORLD AND WE'RE NOT.
IT IS DESPICABLE.
>> NOW, HAVE WE HANDED THEPOWER BACK OVER TO THE
SHIRTLESS, PUTIN.
>> Jon: TWO THINGS, ONE,WAS THAT GUY IN A COW
SUIT?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: I DON'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND FINANCIAL NEWS.
AND NUMBER TWO, OH, PUTINGETS THE CREDIT.
IF WE CAUGHT CHARLIE MANSONWHO GIVES A (bleep)
WHO GETS THE CREDIT. AND I GETTHAT FOX OPPOSES THE SYRIA PEACE
PLAN BECAUSE ITS MODUS OPERANDIIS TO FOMENT DISSENT IN THE FORM
OF A RELENTLESS AND IRRATIONALCONTRARIANISM TO BARACK
OBAMA AND ALL THINGS DEMOCRATICTO ADVANCE ITS ULTIMATE
OBJECTIVE OF CREATINGDELIBERATELY MISINFORMED BODY
POLITIC WHOSE ANGER, FEARMISTRUST AND DISCONTENT
IS THE MANNA ON WHICH ITSUSTAINS ITS PARASITIC
SUCCUBUS-LIKE EXISTENCE.
[LAUGHTER][CHEERING]
[APPLAUSE]>> Jon: I BLACKED OUT
FOR A SECOND.
WAS I SAYING SOMETHING?
BUT FOR SOME REASON, EVENCNN'S CHRIS CUOMO SEEMED
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TURNOF EVENTS.
>> A RUSSIAN PROPOSAL TOHAVE SYRIA HAND OVER ITS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS COULDCHANGE WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS.
IT COULD CHANGE THEENTIRE DEBATE, BUT SHOULD IT?
>> Jon: SHOULD IT? ON ONE HAND,GEOPOLITICAL REALITY JUST
SHIFTED 100%.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WEBUILT THIS GRAPHIC.
♪♪♪[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: LOOK, ISN'T THATTHE PROBLEM NOW?
NEWS NETWORKS AREN'TINVESTED IN RIGHT OR
WRONG.
THEY'RE INVESTED INMOMENTUM.
YOU CAN TAKE US TO WAR ONFALSE INTELLIGENCE AND
PRETENSE, BUT GOD FORBIDYOU REV US UP FOR WAR AND
YOU DON'T DELIVER. THE ONE THINGIN THIS COUNTRY WE WON'T
TOLERATE IS A LITTLE WARFOREPLAY WITHOUT THE PAYOFF.
YOU CAN MAKE DISASTROUSFOREIGN POLICY DECISIONS,
BUT YOU WILL NOT GIVE THISCOUNTRY A CASE OF BLUE
BOMBS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
