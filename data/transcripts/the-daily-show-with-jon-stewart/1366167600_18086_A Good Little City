>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW"!
I'M JON STEWART.
GOT A GOOD GUEST TONIGHT.
MR. TOM CRUISE WILL BE JOINING
US ON THE PROGRAM.
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
ONCE AGAIN HAVING TO START UNDER
JUST HORRIFIC EVENTS HERE IN
THIS COUNTRY.
I REALLY HATE THE FACT THAT I
CAN CROSS REFERENCE MY THOUGHT
TO SO MANY OTHER EVENTS THAT
HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE YEARS OF
A SIMILAR ILK SO I'M NOT GOING
TO.
I'M JUST GOING TO SAY THIS TO
BOSTON: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR ONCE AGAIN IN THE
FACE OF GROSS INHUMANITY
INSPIRING AND SOLIDIFYING MY
BELIEF IN HUMANITY AND THE
PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY.
SO THANK YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE.
(APPLAUSE)
AN AMAZING -- THAT'S QUITE A
LITTLE CITY YOU'VE GOT GOING ON
UP THERE.
AND YOU KNOW NEW YORKERS AND
BOSTON OBVIOUSLY HAVE KIND OF A
LITTLE BIT OF A COMPETITION,
OFTEN TIMES THE TWO CITIES
ACCUSING EACH OTHER OF VARIOUS
LEVELS OF SUCKITUDE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT IT IS IN SITUATIONS LIKE
THIS THAT WE REALIZE THAT IT IS
CLEARLY A SIBLING RIVALRY AND
THAT WE ARE YOUR BROTHERS AND
SISTERS IN THIS TYPE OF EVENT.
AS A CITY THAT KNOWS THE FEELING
OF CONFUSION, ANGER AND GRIEF
AND CHAOS THAT COMES WITH THESE
EVENTS, I CAN TELL YOU FROM
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE: YOU'VE GOT
A HELL OF A CITY GOING THERE AND
YOU'VE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB IN
THE FACE OF ALL THIS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
