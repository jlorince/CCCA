BOSTON IS IN FACT STRONG.
BEFORE WE GET STARTED OBVIOUSLYYOU'RE A LADY SENATOR SO I'M
JUST GOING TO PUT THIS OUT HERE.
[ Laughter ]>> ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S THAT ANGER WE'VE HEARDABOUT.
DO YOU FEEL THAT IN WASHINGTON?
DO YOU FEEL THAT WOMEN ARETREATED DIFFERENTLY, EITHER BY
THE MEDIA OR BY YOUR COLLEAGUESBECAUSE THE SENSE WE GET FROM
WATCHING THESE SHOWS, FORINSTANCE CHELSEA CLINTON'S
GRANDCHILD BEING A FACTORIN HILLARY CLINTON'S
CAREER, OR THOSE TYPES OFTHINGS.
>> YES.>> THAT DOES EXIST?
>> YEP.
>> BECAUSE WE SEEM TO HAVE THETAPES THAT PROVE IT DOES EXIST.
>> UH-HUH.
>> DO YOU ACTIVELY BATTLE ITOR IGNORE IT?
>> THAT IS, WHEN YOU IGNORE IT,YOU ARE ACTIVELY BATTLING IT.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT YOU'REREALLY TRYING TO DO. YOU TRY
TO GET TO THE THINGS THATREALLY MATTER.
TO GET TO THE ISSUES THAT MATTERTO YOU, TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR
VOICE GETS HEARD ON BEHALF OFTHE PEOPLE WHO SENT YOU TO
WASHINGTON TO WORK FOR THEM.
SO YEAH, IT'S A FIGHT BUT IT'STHE RIGHT FIGHT AND YOU JUST GOT
TO HAVE IT.
>> WHEN YOU CAME HERE THE FIRSTTIME YOU WERE A PROFESSOR, YOU
WERE AN ACTIVIST.
THE SECOND TIMED YOU CAME HEREYOU WERE A CANDIDATE FOR
SENATOR, THE THIRD TIME YOU WEREA SENATOR.
I GUESS IN THOSE THREEITERATIONS WHO HAS THE NICEST
BATHROOMS, HARVARDOR THE SENATE?
>> UH YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY THIS ISA COOL STORY ABOUT THE SENATE.
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MANY WOMENSENATORS.
SO FOR THIS YEAR THE FIRST TIMEWE NOW HAVE 20 WOMEN IN THE
UNITED STATES SENATE!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> NICE.
>> ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO SAYWE CAN HOLD THAT APPLAUSE FOR
WHEN WE CAN SAY, WE HAVE ATLEAST 50 WOMEN IN THE UNITED
STATES SENATE. THAT'S WHEN WE'REREALLY GOING TO DO IT.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> BUT THERE WAS JUST ONE
TINY LITTLE WOMEN'S BATHROOM.
SO YOU HAD TO KIND OF --
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?
>> I'M DEAD SERIOUS. AND YOUKIND OF HAD TO SCOOCH SIDEWAYS
AND SEE WHO WAS IN THERE.
I NEVER SAW THE MEN'S ROOM BUTTHEY SEEMED TO BE COMING IN AND
OUT OKAY.
SO ACTUALLY THEY HAD TOMAKE A CHANGE.
THE UNITED STATES SENATE ISCHANGING.
WE NOW HAVE A BIGGER LADIESROOM.
>> CONGRATULATIONS!
[APPLAUSE]>> I CAN JUST IMAGINE THAT
COMING TO THE FLOOR AND THEREPUBLICANS FILIBUSTERING UNTIL
THEY HAD TO USE IT.
[ Laughter ]>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> WHAT WHERE YOU HAVE FOUND THEDIFFERENCE, SO LOOK, BEING IN
THE SENATE VERSUSFIGHTING FROM THE OUTSIDE,
WHAT IS IT LIKE TOFIGHT FROM WITHIN AN
INSTITUTION THAT TO MANYOBSERVERS IS CORRUPTED BY
MONEY, IDEOLOGY AND THE OTHERTYPES OF DOGMA THAT SLOW
THINGS DOWN. HAVE YOU FOUND THATA FRUSTRATION?
>> SO LOOK, THE PROBLEM WE HAVEIN THIS COUNTRY AND
WE'VE HAD FOR A LONG TIME NOW ISWASHINGTON
WORKS FOR THOSE WHO CAN HIREARMIES OF LOBBYISTS AND LAWYERS.
IF YOU ARE A HUGE CORPORATION IFYOU ARE A BILLIONAIRE, BOY YOUR
VOICE GETS HEARD IN THAT PLACE.
AND WHAT YOU WANT GETS ATTENDEDTO.
FOR ORDINARY FAMILIES IT JUSTDOESN'T WORK SO WELL.
SO IT'S REALLY THE SAME KIND OFFIGHT.
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN INVOLVEDIN EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF
FIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.
I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OFTHAT. RIGHT NOW, WHERE WE ARE.
KIDS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO GO TOCOLLEGE, THEIR PARENTS CAN'T
AFFORD TO WRITE THEM A CHECK SOTHEY HAVE TO BORROW MONEY.
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTSAYS WE WILL LEND YOU THE MONEY
TO GO TO SCHOOL.
OK, THAT'S A GOOD THING TO DO.
AND THEN PILES ONTO THE INTERESTRATES SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT
MAKES TENS OF BILLIONSOF DOLLARS IN PROFIT
OFF THE BACKS OF KIDS TRYINT TOGET AN EDUCATION.
I THINK IT'S OBSCENE FOR THEGOVERNMENT TO MAKE PROFITS.
[APPLAUSE]>> Jon: SO, HOW IS THAT LEGAL?
YOU KNOW, BUT THAT DOESN'TSTRIKE ME. SO WHO IS LOBBYING
THE GOVERNMENT TO GET, THATISN'T EVEN A CORPORATE
INTEREST, THAT IS AGOVERNMENT INHERENT INTERNALCORRUPTION IS IT NOT?
>> THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT. SOTO SAY, WHICH I WANT TO DO AND I
THINK WE'RE GOING TO PROPOSENEXT MONTH, REFINANCING THOSE
STUDENT LOANS THAT AREOUTSTANDING, TO BRING DOWN THE
INTEREST RATE, CUT THE INTERESTRATE ON THOSE STUDENT
LOANS. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO
THAT WE HAVE TO FINDSOME PLACE ELSE IN THE
BUDGET TO FIND THAT MONEY. MYVIEW IS WE OUGHT TO CLOSE
A COUPLE OF THOSELOOPHOLES, MAKE BILLIONAIRES
PAY JUST AS MUCH IN TAXES ASTHEIR SECRETARIES DO.
BUT THE LOBBYISTS WON'T LET THATHAPPEN.
>> SURE, SURE. BUT HERE'S WHAT'SFRUSTRATING. I GET THAT.
SO THE FED, THE FED HAS AN OPENWINDOW, A DISCOUNT WINDOW WHERE
THESE BANKS CAN COME IN ANDBORROW AT ZERO PERCENT INTEREST,
THEY CAN GRAB MILLIONS ANDMILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND TURN IT
AROUND AND TURN IT INTOTREASURIES OR WHATEVER IT IS AND
MAKE 3 OR 4% AND TURN IT AROUNDAND SO YOU'RE TELLING ME KIDS
THAT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TOGO TO COLLEGE HAVE TO PAY
INTEREST ON LOANS BUT THESEBANKS WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
CAN COME IN AND BORROW AT ZEROINTEREST AND USE IT AS A MONEY
PRINTING MACHINE --
>> AND THAT'S HOW THE GAME ISRIGGED.
ALL RIGHT, WHEN WE COME BACKWE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT HOW THE
REAL WORLD OF POLITICS INTERACTSWITH THE IDEALS OF POLITICS.
>> MORE WITH SENATOR WARREN WHENWE COME BACK.
