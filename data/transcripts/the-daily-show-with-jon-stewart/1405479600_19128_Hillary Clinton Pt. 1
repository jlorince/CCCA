BACK, SO PEOPLE COULD GETAN IDEA WHAT WE WERE DOING
IN THE WORLD, AND I WROTEMUCH MORE THAN THAT,
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.
SO THIS WAS LIKE TAKE THE WHIPOUT AND TAKE THE SCALPEL AND CUT

REASONED AND EYE WITNESSVIEW TO THE HISTORY OF
THOSE FOUR YEARS.AND I THINK I SPEAK
FOR EVERYBODY WHEN I SAY, NO ONECARES.
THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RERUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

>> YES. PLEASE, PLEASE DO.>> Jon: A LITTLE CONFUSION.
YOU KNOW, IT TAKES ME BACK TO MYDAYS POST-COLLEGE.
LET ME... YOU KNOW, THERE AREWAYS THAT WE CAN DECIDE WHETHER
OR NOT... I HAVE, IT'S LIKE ACAREER APTITUDE TEST.
AND, IT CAN HELP YOU.
>> THIS IS GOOD.
I'M READY. I'M READY.
>> Jon: SO DO YOU... LET ME JUSTASK YOU, BECAUSE THIS IS GOING
TO HELP YOU SORT OF HONE IN ONIF YOU EVEN WANT TO DO THIS
JOB. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:DO YOU LIKE COMMUTING TO WORK OR
DO YOU LIKE A HOME OFFICE?WHAT'S YOUR, UH...
>> NO, I'VE SPENT SO MANY YEARSCOMMUTING, I'D KIND OF PREFER A
HOME OFFICE.
THAT'S WHERE I WROTE MY BOOK.
IT WAS ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF OURHOUSE, SO THAT WORKS.
>> Jon: DO YOU HAVE FAVORITESHAPE FOR THAT HOME OFFICE?
DO YOU LIKE THAT OFFICE, LET'SSAY WOULD YOU LIKE THAT
OFFICE... WOULD YOU LIKE IT TOHAVE CORNERS OR WOULD YOU LIKE
IT NOT TO HAVE CORNERS? I DON'TKNOW.
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THEWORLD IS SO COMPLICATED, THE
FEWER CORNERS THAT YOU CAN HAVE,THE BETTER.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: DO YOU PREFER TO SIT
IN TRAFFIC OR CAUSE IT?
>> I REALLY HATE TO CAUSETRAFFIC, AND SOMETIMES I DO.
AND I DEEPLY REGRET IT.
I'M TELLING THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.
AND WHEN I HAVE OVEREAGER POLICEWHO ARE ACCOMPANYING ME WHO ARE
SO BRAVE AND THEY'RE DOING THEIRBEST JOB, I SOMETIMES HAVE TO
SCROUCH DOWN, GET ON THE FLOOR,I START THIS BOOK TALKING ABOUT
GETTING ON THE FLOOR, HIDING,TRYING TO GO TO A SECRET MEETING
WITH BARACK OBAMA.
THAT HAPPENS TO ME A LOT.
SO, I PREFER NOT TO CAUSETRAFFIC.
>> YOU ACTUALLY TRAVEL LIKE AKID SNEAKING INTO A DRIVE-IN
THEATER? LIKE...
>> YEAH.  I TRY TO. YEAH SO,AND,
AND YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES LIKELITTLE DISGUISES SO I CAN LOOK
OUT THE WINDOW BUT NOBODYWILL KNOW IT'S ME.
>> Jon: WELL LET ME ASK YOU AFINAL QUESTION: DO YOU ENJOY
CONSTANT, NON-STOP CRITICISM?
[LAUGHTER]>> ENJOY IS PROBABLY THE WRONG
WORD.
>> Jon: EXPECT?
>> EXPECT, SURVIVE...>> Jon: SURE.
>> LIVE THROUGH.
IT JUST SORT OF COMES WITH THETERRITORY.
>> Jon: IT DOES COME WITH THETERRITORY.
SO, IT SOUNDS TO ME, IF I MAY,YOU'VE DECLARED FOR THE
PRESIDENCY. WHY ELSE? BECAUSE...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]HERE'S THE CRAZY THING. HAVE YOU
BEEN SURPRISED, IF YOU WERENOT I THINK RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT, ALL OF THISCRITICISM, I TRULY BELIEVE THIS,
THERE'S TWO BOOKS OUT NOWTHAT ARE EXPOSES OF YOU AND
THE FAMILY AND ALL THAT. THEREIS CONSTANT CALLS FOR
TESTIMONY. THERE ARECONSTANT PARSING OF WORDS.
>> YEAH.
IF YOU STOP THAT TOMORROW, IFYOU SAID, I AM NOT RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT, IT ALL STOPS.
DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE?
>> I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULDLOSE THEIR JOBS IF IT ALL
STOPPED. IT SEEMS TO BE...
>> IT WOULD STOP FOR YOU.
THEY'D MOVE ON TO CHRISCHRISTIE OR WHOEVER ELSE.
>> THEY MIGHT.
BUT I'VE BEEN AMAZED AT WHAT ACOTTAGE INDUSTRY IT IS.
AND SO I KIND OF EXPECT IT WOULDCONTINUE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO I'M NOT REALLY PAYING ALOT OF ATTENTION.
>> IT'S JUST THESE TALKINGHEADS, SITTING AROUND, PICKING
OUT EVERY LITTLE THINGAND MAKING FUN OF IT.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST, IT'S NOTRIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]>> COULD I, COULD I SAY THAT I
AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY.
>> Jon: YEAH, NO...WHAT WAS THE ONE THAT TOOK
YOU MOST OFF GUARD,WAS IT THE WE WERE DEAD BROKE,
WHEN YOU SAID THAT?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS ANINARTFUL USE OF WORDS,
OBVIOUSLY. >> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU KNOW, BILL AND I HAVEWORKED REALLY HARD AND WE'VE
BEEN SUCCESSFUL. I'M REALLYGRATEFUL FOR THAT.
>> Jon: RIGHT. >> BUT WHAT I WORRY ABOUT, AND I
TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE BOOK,IS I'M WORRIED THAT OTHER PEOPLE
AND PARTICULARLY YOUNGERPEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE
SAME OPPORTUNITIES WE DID...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WECAME FROM, YOU KNOW,
YOU KNOW, GREAT CIRCUMSTANCES INTERMS OF OUR FAMILY LOVING US
AND, YOU KNOW, BILL HAD A MUCHMORE DIFFICULT UPBRINGING THAN
I DID, BUT STILL WE BELIEVEDTHAT WE COULD PRETTY
MUCH MAKE OUR WAY UP THE LADDER.
AND NOW I THINK A LOT OFPARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T
BELIEVE THAT ANYMORE.
AND THAT BOTHERS ME A LOT.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO I THINK WE HAVE TO PAYATTENTION TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO
DO.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW WHAT'S KINDOF AWESOME? THAT SAYS TO ME
YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?HOW EASILY YOU PIVOTED
FROM THAT INTO INCOME INEQUALITYIN AMERICA.
THAT SAYS TO ME YOU'RE RUNNINGFOR PRESIDENT.
BECAUSE OTHERWISE...
>> BUT THINK ABOUT IT.
THINK ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> I MEAN, YOU AND I HAVE BEENLUCKY.
I THINK WE'D HAVE TO AGREE.RIGHT? I MEAN...
>> Jon: WELL, I DON'T KNOWABOUT LUCKY.
[LAUGHTER]>> WELL, WE BOTH HAVE WORKED
HARD. WE BOTH HAVE WORKED HARD.
>> Jon: NO, WE HAVE. WE HAVEBEEN, WE HAVE BEEN LUCKY.
>> BUT WE ALSO WERE BORN INTOCIRCUMSTANCES, MAINLY BEING IN
THIS COUNTRY, WHERE WE HAD ALLTHESE OPPORTUNITIES AND WERE
ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM.>> Jon: SURE. RIGHT.
SO IN YOUR MIND THOUGH THEN,ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT NO
LONGER EXISTS FOR PEOPLE OR THATWE, THERE IS SOMETHING ABJECTLY
WRONG WITH GOVERNMENT OR THESYSTEM THAT WE NEED TO INFORM?
>> YEAH.  I THINK BOTH.
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'TBELIEVE IT EXISTS FOR THEM
ANYMORE.
AND WE HAVE SIX MILLION YOUNGPEOPLE BETWEEN 16 AND 24 IN OUR
COUNTRY WHO ARE NEITHERIN SCHOOL NOR IN WORK.
THEY'VE KIND OF GIVEN UP.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THAT'S A TERRIBLEDEVELOPMENT.
AND SO, YEAH, I THINK THATPEOPLE DON'T FEEL IT.
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO CHANGEBOTH OUR ECONOMIC AND OUR
POLITICAL SYSTEMS SO THAT WE CANMAKE IT A REALITY AGAIN.
I THINK THAT'S THE BIG BUSINESS.
>> Jon: WHEN WE COME BACK,WILL YOU TELL US HOW TO DO THAT?
>> SURE.
>> Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACKWITH MORE HILLARY CLINTON RIGHT
AFTER THIS.
