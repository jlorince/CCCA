US.
BUT FIRST TONIGHT, IF I MAY,
HE'S BAAACD.
>> PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH
STEPS BACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG
TIME TO DEDICATE HIS
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY.
>> Jon:  HA-HA-
STAY COOL, JOHNNY, BOY.
STAY COOL.
( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE IT'S THE OPENING SER
MOPE OF THE BUSH LIBRARY.
IT'S BEEN FOUR AND A HALF YEARS
SINCE WE'VE SEEN PRESIDENT BUSH.
I IMAGINE LIKE MOST EXPRESIDENT
HE'S DEVOTING HIMSELF TO PUBLIC
SERVICE.
88-YEAR-OLD JIMMY CARTER
LITERALLY PULLING THE LAST
REMAINING GUINEA WORMS OUT OF
POOR CHILDREN'S FEET WITH HIS
HANDS.
LOOK, WHAT'S-- WHAT'S PRESIDENT
BUSH BEEN UP TO?
>>
>> I PAINT TWO OR THREE HOURS A
DAY.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
( CHEERS ).
>> Jon:  SOMETIMES IT'ST
SEEMS ONLY A GALLON OF PAINT,
DROWN OUT THE SCREAMS OF THOSE
I'VE WRONGED.
( LAUGHTER )
PLUS, SOMETIMES THEY LET YOU USE
YOUR FINGERS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> I COULD LAY OUT 20 OF THE
PAINTINGS, AND YOU MIGHT LIKE
ONE.
>> YEAH.
>> AND SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD LIKE
ANOTHER.
>> BUT ARE YOU GETTING BETTER IS
THE QUESTION?
>> I THINK SO.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL IN THE
EYES OF THE BEHOLDER.
>> Jon:  SURE, SO, IN OTHER
WORDS, ART HISTORY WILL BE THE
JUDGE.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
BUT I LOVE PRESIDENTIAL
LIBRARIES.
YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO
FIND IN THIS ONE?
>> THE GEORGE W. BUSH
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM
SITS ON 23 ACRES OF THE SOUTHERN
METHODIST UNIVERSITY CAMPUS.
INSIDE THE COMPLEX, A TREASURE
TROVE OF MORE THAN 43,000
ARTIFACTS FROM THE BUSH
PRESIDENCY.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  BASICALLY THE HARD
ROCK CAFE OF CATASTROPHIC POLICY
DECISIONS.
( LAUGHTER )
NOW, I GUESS THIS IS-- AS GOOD A
TIME FOR BUSH TO OPEN UP A
LIBRARY AS ANY TIME.
>> AS TIME PASSES AND PASSIONS
COOL, MR. BUSH HAS FROAN MORE
POPULAR.
>> A PERFECT EXAMPLE FOR GEORGE
W. BUSH IS HIS FATHER GEORGE
HERBERT WALKER BUSH, WHO LOOKS
FAR BETTER 20 YEARS AFTER
LEAVING OFFICE.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER ).
BECAUSE HE'S BEING COMPARED TO
GEORGE W.
THAT'S WHY HE LOOKS BETTER.
I'M SURE-- LISTEN F-1 OF G.W.'S
KIDS BECOMES PRESIDENT IN 2032
AND SOMEHOW FOR SNOW REASON
INVADES THE MOON, I'M SURE WE'LL
LOOK BACK AT
