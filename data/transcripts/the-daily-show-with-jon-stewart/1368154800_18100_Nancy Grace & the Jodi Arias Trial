>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW, MY NAME IS JON
STEWART.
GOOD ONE TONIGHT.
ONE OF OUR FAVORITE
MRS. DAVID SEDARIS IS GOING
TO BE JOINING US LATER ON
TONIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: BUT FIRST IF YOU GET
YOUR NEWS FROM THE PRINT
MEDIA YOU MIGHT NOT BE AWARE
OF THE BIGGEST STORY OF THE
CENTURY.
>> JODI ARIAS.
>> JODI ARIAS.
>> A VERDICT IS REACHED IN
THE TRIAL OF JODI ARIAS.
>> WE FIND THE DEFENDANT AS
TO COUNT 1 FIRST-DEGREE
MURDER GUILTY.
>> Jon: AN END TO THE SAGA
THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO
WOULD ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING
THEY COULD TO GET OFF JURY
DUTY WERE FIXATED ON FOR 18
WEEKS.
IT IS A SAD STORY ALL
AROUND.
A YOUNG WOMAN POSSIBLY
FACING THE DEATH PENALTY.
THE VICTIM'S FAMILY GETS
JUSTICE BUT IT DOESN'T BRING
BACK THEIR LOVED ONE.
NO ONE SHELLISHES --  --
RELISHES A MOMENT LIKE THIS.
NOBODY DELIGHTS IN THE
GRUESOME SPECTACLE.
NOBODY SLURPS EACH LURID
DETAIL LIKE IT WAS A
PERVERSE JOY, LIKE THEY WERE
AN ENGORGED TRAGEDY TICK.
NOBODY WOULD-- WAIT A MINUTE
S THAT NANCY GRACE?
>> HE WENT TO HIS OWN
BATHROOM MIRROR AND SAW
HIMSELF DYING, AS THE BLOOD
WAS COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH
AND HIS NOSE.
>> Jon: YES, ALL HAIL NANCY
FULL OF GRACE.
WHEREVER YOU HEAR GAVELS AND
SONING, COURT ELVIRA WILL BE
THERE.
THAT'S NOT ROUGE ON HER
CHEEK, SHE DRAWS YOUTH AND
VITALITY FROM HUMAN TRAGEDY.
HOW DO I KNOW?
HERE SHE IS BEFORE THE ARIAS
TRIAL.
YES.
(LAUGHTER)
I HADN'T SEEN THAT, ACTUALLY,
PUT UP AGAINST EACH OTHER.
THAT IS [BLEEP] UP.
BY THE WAY, IF YOU THINK
NANCY GRACE'S DESCRIPTION OF
THE MURDER WAS GRUESOME, YOU
SHOULD HEAR HER EXPLAIN MASS
TO HER KIDS.
IN THIS HE CASE FOUR IS
BRUTALLY RIPPED AWAY FROM 12
LEAVING WHAT?
A BLOODY STUMP OF 8.
(LAUGHTER)
NANCY GRACE PULLED OUT ALL
THE STOPS FOR THE ARIAS
VERDICT.
AND WHO HAS SHE APPARENTLY
HIRED.
THIS IS A HELL OF A BOOKING,
PUNDIT NUMBER FOUR, THE
MURDER LADY.
THE MURDER LADY IN YOUR BOX.
BUT NOW THE VERDICT IS IN,
THE TRIAL IS OVER.
WHAT WILL OUR DARK MISTRESS
DO NOW WITH NO
YOUTH-SUSTAINING SHOW TRIAL
TO FEAST ON.
PERHAPS SHE'LL JUST RETURN
TO THE CRYPT.
>> ARIEL CASTRO MAKING HIS
FIRST COURT APPEARANCE.
IN ABOUT AN HOUR WE WILL
COVER IT LIVE.
DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO SPEAK.
>> HE MAKES ME SICK.
HE MAKES ME SICK.
>> Jon: HE DOESN'T MAKE YOU
SICK.
SO ALIVE.
SUCK HIM DRY.
BY THE TIME THIS TRIAL IS
OVER YOU ARE GOING LOOK LIKE
THIS.
