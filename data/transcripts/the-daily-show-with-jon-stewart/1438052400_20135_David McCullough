(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
SENATOR CRUZ, AT LONG LAST!
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
SHORT NOTICE.
YOU KNOW I'M AN ENORMOUS FAN OFYOURS.
THE BOOK IS CALLED "THE WRIGHTBROTHERS."
I'M SO GLAD THE BOOK IS GETTINGTHE DAVID McCULLOUGH TREATMENT.
THEY ARE AMERICAN ICONS THAT WEHAVE AN ALMOST TWO-DIMENSIONAL
CARTOONISH KNOWLEDGE OF, LIKEFROM HOWARD JOHNSON'S PLACE
MATTS AND DIXIE CUPS, YOU KNOW.
NOBODY REALLY EXPLORES THEREALITY OF THE WRIGHT BROTHERS.
>> WELL, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELYRIGHT, AND I KNEW NEXT TO
NOTHING WHEN I FIRST CAME ACROSSTHEM.
I KNEW THAT THEY WERE A COUPLEOF BICYCLE MECHANICS FROM OHIO,
INVENTED THE AIRPLANE, WHICHCAME TO PROBABLY TEN MINUTES IN
HIGH SCHOOL IN HISTORY CLASS.
BUT, IN FACT, THEY WEREINFINETELY MORE THAN THAT AND
MORE INTERESTING AS HUMANBEINGS, AND BRAVE BEYOND ALMOST
ANYONE I'VE EVER KNOWN MUCHABOUT.
AND THEY WOULD NOT GIVE UP ANDTHEY NEVER LET FAIRLY FAILURE
GET THEM DOWN, AND THEY WEREDETERMINED TO SUCCEED, AND THEY
DID IT ON THEIR OWN ENTIRELY.
THEY HAD NO FOUNDATION BEHINDTHEM.
THEY HAD NO UNIVERSITY BACKING.
THEY HAD NO ANGEL.
>> Jon: THIS WAS NO PROJECT X.
>> YEAH, IT CERTAINLY WASN'T.
THEY HAD NO BACKER.
THEY DID IT ALL WITH THEIR OWNMONEY, ON THEIR OWN STEAM, ON
THEIR OWN INITIATIVE, IN THEIROWN FREE TIME.
THEY HAD VERY LITTLE IN THE WAYOF INCOME.
SAMUEL LANGLEY, THEN THE HEAD OFTHE SMITHSONIAN, BUILT AN
ENORMOUS PUBLIC -- ENORMOUS BYTHE STANDARDS OF THE TIME.
-- A FLYING MACHINE, WHICH HECALLED AERO DROME, AND IT
COST, ALTOGETHER, ABOUT $70,000,WHICH WAS A LOT OF MONEY THEN.
>> Jon: SURE.
AND IT TOOK OFF FROM THE TOPOF A HOUSE BOAT ON THE SHORES OF
THE POTOMAC RIVER, FLEW UP ABOUT60 INTO THE AIR AND DOVE RIGHT
INTO THE WATER.
(LAUGHTER)
THEIR FLYING MACHINE WHICHTHEY FLEW AT KITTY HAWK, NORTH
CAROLINA, IN THE MIDST OF THEWINTER OF 1903, EVERYTHING
INCLUDED FROM GOING BACKAND FORTH TO DAYTON, OHIO, TO
KITTY HAWK, NORTH CAROLINA, LESSTHAN $1,000.
SO THERE WAS VERY LITTLE THATTHEY COULDN'T MAKE WITH THEIR
OWN HANDS.
>> Jon: AND YET, EVEN THOUGHTHEY MADE IT, NO ONE REALLY
CARED EXCEPT IN FRANCE.
>> THEY IGNORED IT.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> OUR GOVERNMENT IGNORED IT.
>> Jon: EVERYBODY IGNORED IT.
>> "NEW YORK TIMES," CHICAGOTRIBUNE, EVEN ONE OF THEIR
DAYOTN PAPERS.
ONE OF THE EDITORS OF ONE OFTHOSE PAPERS YEARS LATER ASKED
"YOU NEVER WROTE ABOUTIT, IT HAPPENED UNDER YOUR
NOSES."
HE SAID, "I GUESS WE WERE JUSTPLAIN STUPID."
>> Jon: I BELEIVE AT THE TIMEWAS THE BYLINE OF THE NEWSPAPER.
(LAUGHTER)
WE'RE JUST PLAIN STUPID.
UH, NEVER FLEW TOGETHER, ALWAYSWERE -- I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT
WAS SO INTERESTING.
SO COGNIZANT OF THE DANGER THATTHEY ONLY WOULD FLY SOLO SO THAT
THE OTHER WOULD BE THERE TOCARRY ON THE WORK IN CASE THEY
WERE KILLED.
>> EXACTLY.
IT WASN'T UNTIL 1909 -- NO,1910 --
>> Jon: I WAS GOING TO CORRECTYOU
(LAUGHTER)
>> I NEED A LOT OF THAT.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> IN FRONT OF A PUBLICDEMONSTRATION, AN AIR SHOW THEY
PUT ON AT AIR TESTING GROUND,WHICH WAS A COW PASTURE OUTSIDE
OF DAYTON, THAT THEY WENT UPTOGETHER, AND WHAT THEY WERE
SAYING TO ANYBODY WHO KNEW THEMWAS, WE'VE DONE IT.
WE'RE ALLOWED TO GO.
AND THE ONLY MEMBER OF THEFAMILY THAT HADN'T BEEN UP WAS
THEIR FATHER.
THE MINISTER.
HE WAS 82 YEARS OLD.
NOBODY THAT AGE HAD EVER GONE UPIN AN AIRPLANE, TO SAY THE
LEAST.
SO ORVILLE TOOK HIM UP AND THEYTOOK OFF IN THIS BIG CROWD OF
LOCALS, NEIGHBORS AND THE REST.
AND THE WHOLE TIME, HE WASSITTING BESIDE ORVILLE ON THE
PLANE, NO SEAT BELTS ORANYTHING--
>> Jon: FIRST CLASS OR COACH?
(LAUGHTER)
>> FIRST CLASS.
HE KEPT SAYING, HIGHER, ORVILLE,HIGHER.
THAT WAS THE SPIRIT OF THEFAMILY.
>> Jon: OH, I THOUGHT YOU WEREGOING TO SAY BECAUSE IT'S NEVER
ENOUGH.
I BUILT AN AIRPLANE!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HIGHER!
(LAUGHTER)
>> ONE OF MY FAVORITE LINESIS, WILBUR WAS ASKED ABOUT DO
YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR PEOPLEWHO WANT TO SUCCEED IN LIFE?
HE SAID, YES, PICK OUT A GOODMOTHER AND FATHER AND GROW UP IN
OHIO.
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THAT'S WONDERFUL!
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US!
I TRULY APPRECIATE IT!
THE WRIGHT BROTHERS! IT'S ON THEBOOKSHELVES NOW.
DAVID McCOLLOUGH!
