OBAMACARE. YOU KNOW, OBAMACARE.
WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THESUFFERING THAT IT WOULD BRING.
SO NOW THAT'S IT'S HERE, WEWOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO'S
SUFFERING. JORDANKLEPPER REPORTS.
>> FOR YEARS, TELEVISION PUNDITSHAVE BEEN DOING IMPORTANT WORK
SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUTOBAMACARE.
>> WE'RE GOING TO BE SIX TOTEN MONTHS FROM NOW IN A MASSIVE
FISCAL CRISIS.
>> C'MON!
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.
>> OBAMACARE LITERALLY MAYKILL YOU.
>> GOOD, KEEP GOING.
>> THE WORST THING THAT HASHAPPENED IN THIS NATION SINCE
SLAVERY.
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKINGABOUT.
AND NOW THAT THE LAW IS HERE ANDIN EFFECT LET'S SEE WHAT THIS
(BLEEP) STORM HAS BROUGHT.
>> EVERY DAY THE EXPERIENCE WITHOBAMACARE IS IMPROVING.
>> THE LAW WILL COST $5 BILLIONLESS THAN PROJECTED.
>> WE HAVE THE LOWESTMONTHLY UNINSURED RATE THAT WE
HAVE EVER HAD.
>> EVEN BETTER NEWS, PREMIUMSARE LOWER THAN EXPECTED.
>> STOP!
STOP!
THAT'S NOT LIKE SLAVERY AT ALL.EVIDENTLY THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS
WITH THE PROBLEMS WITH OBAMACARE
AND NOW ONLY 36% OF AMERICANSSUPPORT REPEAL.
TO GET AMERICA TO FALL BACK INHATE WITH THE LAW, I NEED HELP.
I SAT DOWN WITH OBAMACARE CRITICBETSY DEATH PANEL McCOY.
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH ROAD FOR THECRITICS OF THIS LAW.
IF PEOPLE AREN'T BEHINDREPEALING THIS, HOW ARE WE
GOING TO GET THEM ON OUR SIDE?
>> I'M GOING TO JUST TURN THISOFF FOR A SECOND.
>> BUT SHE WAS TOO UPSET TO TALKABOUT IT -- I GUESS.
SO IT WAS UP TO ME TO FIND A NEWDOOMS-DAY DIAGNOSIS TO STOP
OBAMACARE
NURSE JANET RUNBACK.
>> I LOST MY JOB AS A DIRECTRESULT OF OBAMACARE.
>> YES, OBAMACARE WILLMURDER YOUR JOB.
THAT IS GOLD.
NURSE'S JOB KILLED TO DEATH BYOBAMACARE.
CAN YOU LOOK TO THAT CAMERA ANDTELL ME JUST HOW HEART BROKEN
YOU ARE.
>> I AM SO THRILLED TO HAVE LOSTTHAT JOB.
>> WAIT, YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUTLOSING YOUR JOB?
>> I RAN A FREE CLINIC AND AJANITOR'S LUNCHROOM,
OBAMACARE CAME ALONG AND MYPATIENTS WERE FOR THE FIRST TIME
ABLE TO GET INSURANCE TO TAKECARE OF THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS.
>> (BLEEP) IT.
I CAN SPIN THIS.
SICK PATIENTS TYRANICALLYREMOVED FROM A JANITOR'S
LUNCHROOM, TRAGICALLY RECEIVINGHEALTHCARE --
>> THERE IS NOTHING TRAGIC HERE.
NOBODY IS CALLING ME TO ASK FORFREE HEALTHCARE ANYMORE.
>> BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE.
>> BECAUSE OF OBAMACARE.
>> BUT I SAID THAT IN A NEGATIVEWAY.
YOU'RE SAYING IT IN A HAPPY WAY.
>> YES, I AM.
IT WORKS!
>> MAYBE A VISIT TO THE FORMERCLINIC/JANITOR'S LUNCHROOM WOULD
HELP THE TEARS FLOW.
JOINED BY THE FORMER MEDICALDIRECTOR DR. MARY, WE TOURED THE
STATE-OF-THE-ART MEDICALFACILITY EQUIPPED WITH ALL THE
DIRTY CUPS AND RANDOMTRASH PATIENTS COULD EVER NEED.
>> THIS IS WHERE OUR OPTOMETRISTAND OPHTHALMOLOGISTS WOULD DO
DIABETIC EYE CHECKS.
>> AND OBAMACARE HAS KICKEDPEOPLE OUT OF THIS ROOM
AND INTO FULLY STAFFEDHOSPITALS.
>> YES. GETTING SOMEONE'SDIABETES UNDER CONTROL CAN
PREVENT RENAL FAILURE ANDDIALYSIS IN KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS.
IT CAN PREVENT BLINDNESS, IT CANPREVENT MASSIVE INFECTIONS WITH
HOSPITALIZATIONS AND AMPUTATIONSAND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.
>> HOW DOES THAT MATH WORK?
>> THOSE THINGS I JUST TALKEDABOUT, THE COMPLICATIONS COST A
LOT MORE THAN A MONTH'S WORTH OFINSULIN AND A FEW BLOOD TESTS.
>> WHATEVER, LADY.
I WAS AT LEAST GOING TO WALK OUTWITH A SAD GROUP HUG.
>> NO SAD HUGS.
WE'RE HAPPY.
>> VERY SATISFIED.
>> GIVE YOURSELF A HUG.
>> I'M DOING THAT, THANK YOU.

HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS.
TIME TO GO TO THE HORSE'S MOUTH.
THE FORMER PATIENTS OF THECLINIC WHO ARE NOW LIVING THE
NIGHTMARE THAT IS OBAMACARE.
>> RAISE YOUR HANDS IF YOU THINKOBAMACARE WILL DESTROY
AMERICA.
OKAY.
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
DON'T RAISE YOUR HANDS IF YOUTHINK OBAMACARE WILL DESTROY
AMERICA.
>> WITH OBAMACARE, I'VE GOT AGREAT DOCTOR AND EVERYTHING
SEEMS TO BE WORKING IN MYDIRECTION NOW.
>> MY EXPERIENCES HAVE BEENEXCELLENT.
>> THEY WERE GIVING ME NOTHING.
OBVIOUSLY BIASED BY THEIRPERSONAL POSITIVE EXPERIENCES.
LITTLE CONSOLATION FOR JANETRUNBECK WHO REMAINS TRAGICALLY
JOBLESS. SO, YOU'RE PROBABLYSPENDING YOUR DAYS DOING
NOTHING NOW.
>> NO, ACTUALLY, I HAVE MOVEDON.
NOW I CAN GO ELSEWHERE AND DOOTHER THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED BY
OTHER PEOPLE.
I'M WORKING ON CAUSES SUCH ASHUMAN TRAFFICKING.
