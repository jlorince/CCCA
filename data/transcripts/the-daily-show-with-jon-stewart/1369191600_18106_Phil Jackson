>> WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT LEGENDARY
NBA COACH WHO HAS WON 11
CHAMPIONSHIPS AS THE COACH,
TWO AS AN NBA PLAYER.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED 11
RING, THE SOLE OF SUCCESS.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE
PROGRAM MR. PHIL JACKSON.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> WAIT A MINUTE, DO YOU
REALIZE WE'RE THE SAME SIZE
RIGHT NOW.
>> ALL RIGHT, THE BOOK IS
11-- LOOK AT THIS ONE OF
THESE MAKES YOU THE GREEN
LANTERN BUT WHERE-- BUT YOU
HAVE TWO PLAYER RINGS FROM
THE KNICKS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> WHERE ARE THEY?
>> THEY ARE NOT PART OF
COACHING.
THIS IS ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND
COACHING AND THAT KIND OF
STUFF.
THOSE ARE WARRIORSHIP AND
PLAYING, RIGHT.
>> BUT I AM-- THEY ARE
GREAT.
THEY ARE GREAT RINGS.
>> I HAVE TO SAY, SO MUCH OF
WHAT THIS BOOK IS ABOUT IS
MANAGING NOT THESE JUST
LARGER-THAN-LIFE PHYSICAL
PEOPLE BUT THE
LARGER-THAN-LIFE
PERSONALITIES.
THE CHAPTERS ON THE SHACK
AND KOBE RELATIONSHIP SEEM
ESPECIALLY TENUOUS, THAT
EACH, YOU KNOW, SHAQ AND
COULD BEE BOTH HAVE STRONG
PERSONALITIES T SEEMED LIKE
NAVIGATE FLAG WAS ONE OF THE
BIGGER CHALLENGES.
>> IT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF
THE HARDEST CHALLENGES I HAD
IN COACHING OVER ALL THOSE
YEARS, 20 YEARS THAT I
COACHED.
BECAUSE THERE WAS ALWAYS
THIS LITTLE TENSION ABOUT MY
TEAM, IT'S MY TEAM, PLAY
BALL MY STYLE, GET THE BALL
INSIDE, NO, I WANT TO DO
STUFF OUT THAT TYPE OF
THING.
>> Jon: BUT YOU TALK ABOUT
HOW YOU LET IT GO.
THERE IS A VERY -- THE BOOK
IS LACED WITH SORT OF MUTED
TEACHINGS OF SORT OF INNER
PEACE.
YOU SAID LET THEM BURN IT
OUT.
YOU NEVER INTERVENED IN
THEIR SQUABBLE, YOU LET THEM
BURN IT OUT.
HAVE YOU READ THIS BOOK, BY
THE WAY.
>> NO, I WROTE IT.
>> Jon: YOU SEEM SOMEWHAT
UNFAMILIAR WITH IT.
>> THE IDEA IS THAT
BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE
A PARENT, YOU HAVE TWO KIDS,
ARE YOU GOING TO GET
INVOLVED IN EVERY SQUABBLE
THAT HAPPENS IN YOUR HOUSE
THAT THEY-- YOU JUST CAN'T
DO THAT.
YOU WARE YOURSELF OUT TRYING
TO MONITOR ALL THAT.
SO THE BIG STUFF COMES ALONG,
YOU SAVE THE BIG STUFF FOR
THE RIGHT TIME.
>> Jon: YOU JUST SAVED MY
LIFE.
I HAVE TWO LITTLES AT HOME
AND I MONITOR EVERY des
CURRENT SEE.
NOW WHEN YOU WATCH COBE NOW,
ARE YOU TEMPTED TO-- I KNOW
THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK
ABOUT ALL THESE SUPERSTARS,
BUT DOW WATCH THAT, DOW WANT
TO CALL HIM, DO YOU SEND
ADVICE OR ARE YOU JUST
COMPLETELY HANDS-OFF IN
THESE SITUATIONS.
>> NO, IT'S HANDS-OFF.
YOU KNOW, KOBE TEXTED ME A
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME.
WE SEND MESSAGES BACK AND
FORTH.
AND I WILL JUST SAY, YOU
KNOW, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
ARE-- OR THINGS WERE TOUGH,
YOU HAD TO DO SO MUCH WORK
LAST NIGHT, YOU KNOW, TRYING
TO SCORE, CARRY THE TEAM
WHEN YOU ARE DOWN, WHATEVER.
BUT WE NEVER GET INTO THE
OFFENSIVE END OF STUFF.
YOU KNOW, WE NEVER TALK
ABOUT THE DEFENSE EITHER.
WE JUST LET THE GAME COME
AND JUST TALK ABOUT THE
INDIVIDUAL GAME.
>> RIGHT.
>> SINCE I WAS ALMOST HIRED
BY THE LAKERS AND THEN NOT
HIRED BY THE LAKERS.
>> DID THEY CALL YOU AND TRY
AND GET YOU BECAUSE I WAS
UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT
YOU WERE NOT INTERESTED IN
COACHING ANY MORE.
>> THAT'S WHAT I TOLD-- THE
GENERAL MANAGER, THAT YOU
KNOW, I WASN'T INTERESTED IN
KOCHK.
BUT OF COURSE I LIVE IN.
WILL AMOUNT OF AND ALL THOSE
PLAYERS THAT WERE ON THE
LAKERS WERE PLAYERS THAT
WERE ON THE TEAM THAT I
COACHED BEFORE.
SO MY FIANCEE SAID WILL YOU
PLEASE LISTEN THEM AND LET
THEM EXPLAIN WHY THEY WANT
YOU TO COACH THE TEAM.
>> WHAT IS HER RELATIONSHIP
TO THE LAKERS, IF YOU MAY?
>> SHE IS THE VICE PRESIDENT
IN CHARGE OF FINANCE.
>> OH.
>> SO YOUR FIANCEE, THE VICE
PRESIDENT IN CHARGE SAYS YOU
SHOULD REALLY LISTEN THE
LAKERS AND YOU SAY HONEY,
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT THAT
INTERESTED?
DOES SHE ACCEPT THAT OR DOES
SHE PUT ON HER VICE
PRESIDENT HAT AND TRY AND
CONVINCE YOU.
>> SHE STAYED OUT OF IT SHE
DOESN'T WANT TO BE A PART OF
BASKETBALL.
SHE WANTS TO BE PART-- SHE
ALWAYS SAYS I MAKE THE
MONEY.
THEY SPEND THE MONEY, THAT'S
HER LIFE.
>> SO SHE'S NOT PART OF THE
DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS OF
BASKETBALL.
>> RIGHT.
>> SHE GETS THE MARKETING
AND THE TICKETS AND THAT
OTHER STUFF.
TV RIGHTS, ET CETERA.
>> RIGHT.
>> SO SHE SAYS WHEN PEOPLE
ASK YOU COULD STILL COACH,
TELL THEM I THINK YOU CAN.
EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T WANT
TO.
>> WAS THERE A NUMBER?
IF THEY HAD HIT A NUMBER
WOULD YOU HAVE SAID ACTUALLY
I AM SOMEWHAT INTERESTED?
>> NO, I AM SUCH A FOOL, I
SAID MONEY'S NOT A PROBLEM.
>> SU DID SAY THAT.
>> YES.
>> Jon: ARE YOU A FOOL.
YOU'RE NOT, WHAT ABOUT THE
KNICKS, WOULD YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT COMING BACK-- WHAT
ABOUT THE NETS THEY ARE
LOOKING FOR A GUY.
>> THEY CALLED AND I SAID NO
THANK YOU.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN
COACHING.
>> Jon: BUT SEE WHEN YOU SAY
THAT, BEHIND YOUR EYES IS
I'M INTERESTED IN COACHING.
LIKE YOU'RE NOT-- YOU'RE
SAYING TO ME I'M NOT
INTERESTED IN COACHING BUT
YOUR MUSTACHE SAYS GET ME ON
THE COURT.
YOU'RE NOT-- YOU SEE WHAT I
AM SAYING?
I DON'T BELIEVE IT I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.
>> YOU KNOW, MY HEAD MAYBE
INTERESTED IN COACHING BUT
MY BODY CAN'T TAKE IT
ANYMORE RZ REALLY, IT'S
GRUELING.
>> IT IS GRUELING, REAL
GRUELING RZ NO, I COULD SEE
THAT AND THE TRAVEL AND UP
AND DOWN, 82 GAME SEASON
THAT IS NO EASY PEASSY.
BUT IT IS STILL GOOD TO KNOW
YOU ARE INTERESTED IN
COACHING.
11 LINGS, THIS MAN HAS, TWO
AS A PLAYER.
ON THE BOOK SHELVES NOW,
GOOD WISDOM, PHIL JACKSON,
EVERYBODY.
>> THANK YOU.
