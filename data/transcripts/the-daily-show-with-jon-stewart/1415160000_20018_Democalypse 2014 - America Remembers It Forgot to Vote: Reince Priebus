>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK WITH THECHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL COMMITTEE WHO I CANIMAGINE, CNN SHOULD HAVE USED
HIS ERECTION TONIGHTBECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT MAY EVEN
BE MORE VISIBLE THAN THE EMPIRESTATE BUILDING'S SPIRE.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S BEEN A GOOD NIGHT I GUESS
FOR THE REPUBLICANS, I GUESSIS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY.
HERE'S ONE SENATE SEAT THAT THEDEMOCRATS HAD TO HAVE,
IT'S IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SENATORJEANNE SHAHEEN WAS RUNNING
AGAINST SCOTT BROWN,THE REPUBLICAN.
THE RESULTS ARE IN.
SHAHEEN HAS DEFEATED SCOTT BROWN(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
APPARENTLY, VERMONT HAS NOWERECTED A BORDER FENCE TO KEEP
SCOTT BROWN FROM RUNNING THERE.(LAUGHTER)
SO, AND THIS IS ONE THAT ITHOUGHT PEOPLE WOULD BE
INTERESTED IN, THE FLORIDA RACEBETWEEN CHARLIE CRIST BALL FAN
AND GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT CAMEDOWN TO THE WIRE, THE RESULTS
ARE IN, GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT HASDEFEATED CHARLIE CRIST
-- AND THEN WAIT, WHAT THE NO --NO!
WHAT A TERRIBLE SITUATION FORCHARLIE CRIST TO BE EATEN BY A
GATOR.
HOW IRONIC.
(LAUGHTER)JOINING US VIA SATELLITE FROM
G.O.P. HEADQUARTERS, IAPOLOGIZE, THERE'S A BIT OF A
DELAY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CANHEAR ME, SIR. THERE MAY BE A
LITTLE  BIT OF A DELAY.
PLEASE WELCOME, CHAIRMAN OF THEREPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE
REINCE PRIEBUS. REINCE, HOW AREYOU, SIR?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?>> I'M DOING GREAT, JON.
>> Jon: YOU CAN HEAR ME.
>> I CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE.YEAH.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: IS THIS THE GREATEST
NIGHT OF YOUR LIFE?
(CHUCKLES)>> IT RANKS UP THERE, JON, WITH
A LOT OF GOOD NIGHTS. BUTTONIGHT IS CERTAINLY HISTORIC
AND I THINK THAT OBVIOUSLYWE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING MORE
WINS TONIGHT IN THE SENATE ANDTHERE'S MORE TO COME.
>> Jon: IT'S A BLOOD BATH OUTTHERE.
(LAUGHTER)WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT THE
DEMOCRATS' STRATEGY SEEMED TOBE -- AGAIN, I'M NOT A POLITICAL
STRATEGIST -- CURLING UP IN ABALL AND HOPING YOU DIDN'T KICK
THEM IN THE FACE TOO HARD?
WAS THAT A SURPRISING STRATEGY?
>> IT WAS A SURPRISING STRATEGY.
(LAUGHTER)WE KEPT OUR HEAD DOWN AND WE
WORKED HARD AND WE GOT GREATCANDIDATES OUT THERE AND I THINK
IT REALLY IS A REJECTION OFWASHINGTON, A REJECTION OF OBAMA
AND REALLY A NEED FOR THISCOUNTRY TO GET THIS ECONOMY
TURNED AROUND AND, OBVIOUSLY,TONIGHT IS THE START OF THAT.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHTWAS SO INTERESTING.
YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD ALL THESEMONTHS OF JOB GROWTH.
MAY NOT BE GREAT JOB GROWTH BUTIT'S GROWTH,
WE'VE HAD A GDP INTEREST.
BUT THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT SEEMIN ANY WAY INTERESTED IN TRYING
TO TELL THAT STORY. AND I MEAN,
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, AND IFOLLOW THE ELECTIONS -- WELL, I
DON'T FOLLOW THEM --(LAUGHTER)
-- BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHATREPUBLICANS RAN ON OTHER THAN
OBAMA IS STALIN AND EBOLA ISGOING TO KILL YOUR GRANDPARENTS.
WHAT, WHAT WAS -- YEAH --
>> WELL, JON.  WELL, I MEAN,EACH OF THESE STATES HAVE
THEIR OWN UNIQUE STORY.>> Jon: SURE.
>> I MEAN, I CAN TELL YOU LIKEIN WISCONSIN, OBVIOUSLY, SCOTT
WALKER IS TALKING ABOUT HIS OWNSUCCESSES IN WISCONSIN.
JONI ERNST IS TALKING ABOUT HERPLAN TO PASS A BUDGET IN THE
SENATE, TO PASS KEYSTONEPIPELINE IN THE SENATE.
BUT THEY ALSO TIED I THINK ANATTITUDE THAT WAS PERVASIVE
AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT PEOPLEWEREN'T HAPPY WITH THIS
PRESIDENT, THEY DIDN'T THINK HEWAS LEADING ABROAD AND HE WASN'T
ENGAGING DOMESTICALLY, SO SOMEOF THE THINGS THAT MAY HAVE
BEEN HAPPENING THAT WEREPOSITIVE IN REGARD TO JOBS AND
THE STOCK MARKET, ETCETERA, PEOPLE WEREN'T
FEELING THAT ATHOME. SO IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF WISCONSIN OR IN THE MIDDLE OFCOLORADO,
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE THE ECONOMYIS DOING ANY BETTER FOR YOU.
>> Jon: WHAT I LOVE ABOUT ITIS YOU ONLY TALK IN SWING
STATES. THERE'S ONLY --
(LAUGHTER)>> THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO US.
>> Jon: SO LET ME, IS IT -- AREYOU EXCITED ABOUT GOVERNING
AGAIN? BECAUSE IT'S, YOU KNOW,FOR SIX YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN IN
OPPOSITIONAL POSITION TRYING TOSTOP ANYTHING.
IS IT GOING TO BE HARD TO STOPTHAT?
IS IT GOING TO BE HARD TO DOTHINGS?
(LAUGHTER)>> THAT FEELING. NO, I --
(LAUGHTER)LISTEN...
>> Jon: SETTLE DOWN! SETTLEDOWN.
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WHATWE'RE GONNA SEE IS THE PRESIDENT
IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO THETABLE AND I THINK THAT BOTH
PARTIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TOWORK TOGETHER TO
GET THINGS DONE.
YOU DO NEED THE PRESIDENT'SSIGNATURE ON A BILL AND WE
STILL NEED TO DO THAT, BUT IT'SGOING TO TAKE THE PRESIDENT
SAYING, LISTEN, I WANT TO WORKWITH YOU, I WANT TO PASS SOME OF
THESE JOBS BILLS, I WANT TO PASSTHE KEYSTONE PIPELINE AND GET
THINGS DONE.
BUT IT STARTS WITH THE PRESIDENTSO NOW I THINK WE CAN BOX HIM IN
AND GET THIS DONE.
>> Jon: IS THERE -- RIGHT -- ISTHERE ANY THOUGHT AT SOME POINT
YOU WILL JUST LEARN HISSIGNATURE AND, REALLY,
IT WILL BE YOUR OWN COUNTRYAT THAT POINT?
(LAUGHTER)>> WELL LISTEN, IF THE NIGHT
GETS ANY BETTER, MAYBE WECAN DO THAT, TOO.
BUT WE'LL WAIT AND SEE.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, WELL,CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU, SIR.
OBVIOUSLY CONGRATULATIONS TO THEREPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.
REINCE PRIEBUS, THANKS FORJOINING US.
WE APPRECIATE IT.>> THANK YOU, JON.
>> Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACKAFTER THIS.
THANK YOU.
