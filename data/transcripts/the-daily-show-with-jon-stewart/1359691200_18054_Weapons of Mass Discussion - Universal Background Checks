JEEZ, WHERE DID SHE LIVE THE ALAMO?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
LET'S MOVE TO THE NRA PROPOSAL.
WE'LL MOVE TO SOMETHING MORE MAINSTREAM.
UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.
>> OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SOME BACKGROUND CHECKS.
IT'S HOW ENCOMPASSING DO YOU DO IT?
DO YOU DO IT TO A FATHER SELLING TO A SON, OR ANOTHER RELATIVE.
HOW DO YOU COVER EVERYTHING?
I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE.
AND ALSO THE EXTENT OF WHICH YOU HAVE PRIVATE SALES ON SUNDAY BETWEEN RELATIVES.

>> Jon: I'M NOT GOING TO PASS JUDGMENTEN -- JUDGMENT ON A CULTURE WHICH IS FOREIGN TO ME
BUT IS THAT REALLY HOW IT WORKS, SUNDAY IS FAMILY GUN SWAP DAY?
IS THAT HOW IT GOES?
I HAVE TO GET OUT MORE.
ANYONE ELSE HAVE A REASON.
>> WHEN IT COMES TO BACKGROUND CHECKS, LET'S BE HONEST.
THEY'LL NEVER BE UNIVERSAL BECAUSE CRIMINALS WILL NEVER SUBMIT TO THEM.
>> Jon: GOOD POINT LET'S PASS LAWS THAT ONLY CRIMINALS WILL IMMEDIATELY OBEY.
LET'S DO THAT.
WHAT IS THIS THOU SHALT NOT KILL.
MURDERERS WILL BYPASS THAT.
THEY'LL FIND A WAY AROUND IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST HERE.
I KNOW THE MAIN LOBBYIST FOR GUN MANUFACTURERS HAS A UNIQUE INSIGHT ON TO WHETHER BACKGROUND
CHECKS WORK.
LET'S ASK YOU, WHY DO YOU THINK?
>> BACKGROUND CHECKS WORK.
>> Jon: SAYS YOU!
[ LAUGHTER ]
BALTIMORE COUNTY POLICE CHIEF.
BACK IT UP.
>> THEY STOP NEARLY TWO MILLION PROHIBITED PURCHASES BETWEEN 1994 AND 2009.
EXTENDING A BACKGROUND CHECK TO ALL FIREARM PURCHASES COULD EASILY BE IMPLEMENTED AND IT
SHOULD BE WITHOUT DELAY.
>> Jon: YOU SAY THAT AND THEY SAY IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL.
HUMOR ME, LET'S SAY FOR A MINUTE BACKGROUND CHECKS WILL WORK, ANY OTHER REASON NOT TO DO IT?
>> I JUST DON'T THINK LAW-ABIDING PEOPLE WANT EVERY GUN SALE IN THE COUNTRY UNDER
THE THUMB OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: EXCEPT THAT LITERALLY ALMOST ALL OF THEM DO.
INCLUDING ALMOST ALL AMERICANS LIVING WITH A MEMBER OF THE NRA.
I KNOW A GENTLEMAN WHO MAKES A WONDERFUL CASE FOR UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS REASONABLE AND WHAT IS NOT.
WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO PROVIDE MANDATORY INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR
EVERY SALE AT EVERY GUN SHOW.
NO LOOPHOLES ANYWHERE FOR ANYONE.
>> Jon: WOW, BACKGROUND CHECKS USED TO BE SUPPORTED BY 100% OF WAYNE'S LA PIERRE.
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE LAST TIME HE
