>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE FROM THE SAME STATE AS THE FIRST HOOTER.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THIS MORNING'S NEWS OUT OF THE SUPREME COURT.
A DECISION REGARDING ARIZONA'S LANDMARK IMMIGRATION LAW SB1070.
YOU'LL RECALL THE LAW REQUIRED ARIZONA POLICE TO ASK ANYONE THEY STOPPED WHO THEY THEN
SUSPECT OF BEING UNDOCUMENTED FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION PAPERS.
CAVEAT BEING AS LONG AS SOME OF THE TIME THEY PRETEND THEY THOUGHT THE PERSON MIGHT BE AN
ILLEGAL CANADIAN.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION CHALLENGED THE LAW.
ARIZONA JAN BREWER MAINTAINED IT WAS ALL CONSTITUTIONAL.
LET'S SEE WHO WON.
>> IT IS A VICTORY FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
>> I THINK THIS IS A VICTORY FOR ARIZONA.
>> VICTORY FOR JAN BREWER.
Jon: A VICTORY FOR OBAMA,
ARIZONA AND GOVERNOR BREWER.
A WIN-WIN-WIN.
WHO LOST HERE?
>> BIG DEFEAT FOR THE PRESIDENT.
THIS IS A HUGE BLOW TO ARIZONA.
>> A PROFOUND DEFEAT FOR GOVERNOR BREWER.
>> Jon: ARE YOU [BLEEP] WITH ME?
DEFEAT FOR THE PRESIDENT,
ARIZONA AND GOVERNOR BREWER.
AS ALWAYS, NEWS NETWORKS, YOUR ANALYSIS IS SPOT-ON DEAD-WRONG.
ACTUALLY I CAN UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S CONFUSION.
THE VERDICT WAS MIXED.
THE COURT FOUND THREE OF THE ARIZONA LAW'S FOUR PROVISIONS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
IT LEFT INTACT A PART SAYING POLICE CAN CHECK IMMIGRATION STATUS BUT ONLY FOR PEOPLE THEY
STOPPED FOR OTHER REASONS.
BUT IT ALSO SAID THAT PROVISION COULD BE CHALLENGED AT THE STATE LEVEL.
I GUESS THERE'S NO ONE EVERYONE AGREES EITHER WON OR LOST.
>> IT'S A TERRIBLE DAY FOR ROMNEY.
>> A BAD DAY FOR MITT ROMNEY.
THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST OF ALL OUTCOMES IF YOU'RE MITT ROMNEY.
>> Jon: OH, PLEASE.
ACTUALLY I THINK THE WORST OF ALL OUTCOMES FOR MITT ROMNEY WOULD BE IF JESUS COMES BACK BUT
SAYS HE LOVES COFFEE AND SWEARING.
THAT WOULD BE BAD FOR ROMNEY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) MY NAME IS JESUS, GIVE ME A
[BLEEP] LATTE: SEND YOUR LETTERS TO BRIAN WILLIAMS.
CARE OF NBC.
ACTUALLY, TODAY'S RULING HIGHLIGHTS A BIT OF A PROBLEM FOR MITT ROMNEY.
DURING THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY A BIT OF A HARD-LINER ON THE WHOLE IMMIGRATION ISSUE
>> THE RIGHT COURSE FOR AMERICA IS TO DROP THESE LAWSUITS AGAINST ARIZONA AND OTHER STATES
THAT ARE TRYING TO DO THE JOB BARACK OBAMA ISN'T DOING
>> THE ANSWER IS SELF DEPORTATION WHICH IS PEOPLE DECIDE THEY CAN DO BETTER BY
GOING HOME BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND WORK HERE.
I'LL COMPLETE THE FENCE, MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH BORDER PATROL AGENTS
>> Jon: I WILL USE THE BANKS OF THE RIO GRANDE AND THEN I WILL TILT AMERICA SLIGHTLY UP ABOUT
38 DEGREES.
THAT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
