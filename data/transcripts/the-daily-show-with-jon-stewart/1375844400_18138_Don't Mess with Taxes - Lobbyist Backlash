ACTUALLY WORK.
IT SPEAKS.
IT SPEAKS TO HOW BROKEN THE
ENTIRE SYSTEM IS THAT THIS STORY
IS BOTH COMPLETELY LUDICROUS AND
COMPLETELY LOGICAL.
IT'S ALSO HAD AN AMAZING LACK OF
COVERAGE.
WE FOUND THREE STORIES ON IT.
ONE WAS THE CNBC STORY THAT YOU
SAW EARLIER.
FOX MENTIONED IT ONCE IN
PASSING.
THE OTHER WAS ON CNN WHO, LIKE A
FLIRTATIOUS CAT, BRIEFLY BRUSHED
UP AGAINST THIS STORY'S LEG.
>> OUR IDEAS OUR ELECTED
OFFICIALS FLOAT TO FIX THE TAX
SYSTEM.
WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THEM,
RIGHT?
WRONG.
SENATORS ARE TOP SECRET IN THE
LAST 50 YEARS SO WASHINGTON'S
IDEAS FOR HOW TO COLLECT AND
SPEND YOUR MONEY DOESN'T INVOLVE
YOU.
CHECK OUT THAT STORY AT CNN
MONEY DOT-COM
>> John: DON'T THROW IT TO THE
WEB.
YOU HAD SOME ACTUAL NEWS THERE.
FOR MORE ON THIS WE GO TO AASIF
MANDVI WHO IS IN D.C.
SO AASIF...
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
AASIF, AN EMBLEMATIC STORY ABOUT
A KEY ISSUE WITH LEGISLATORS TOO
TERRIFIED TO ADDRESS IT AND
REPORTERS TOO INCOMPETENT TO
COVER IT.
>> HOLD ON, JOHN.
NOT INCOMPETENT.
I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE HOW
TOXIC TAX REFORM IS IN
WASHINGTON.
TO GO ANYWHERE NEAR IT, YOU NEED
SOME REAL AND -- PARDON MY
FRENCH -- COJONES
>> John: I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S
SPANISH.
>> WHATEVER.
I AM A REPORTER WITH TWO
COJONES.
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS
ISSUE NO MATTER HOW DANGEROUS IT
IS IN THIS TOWN.
I HAVE IN MY HAND HERE AN ACTUAL
LIST OF POWERFUL WASHINGTON
LOBBYISTS HELL BENT ON
PREVENTING TAX REFORM.
EVERYONE FROM THE CHAMBER OF...
>> John: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
AASIF, AASIF.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
KEEP VERY STILL.
KEEP VERY STILL.
I DON'T WANT TO ALARM YOU BUT IT
WOULD APPEAR THAT YOU ARE BEING
LASER-TARGETED.
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS?
>> YES, OF COURSE.
IT'S A HUGE STORY.
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.
DON'T WORRY.
THESE LASERS ARE JUST HERE TO
INTIMIDATE ME.
I AM ON TELEVISION.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO
ANYTHING, OKAY.
ANYWAY, TOP OF THE LIST HERE IS
THE CHAMBER OF... (GUNSHOT) OH,
[BLEEP].
>> John: [BLEEP].
YOU'VE BEEN TARGETED.
>> I'M FINE, FINE.
John: NO, YOU'RE NOT FINE.
I'M NOT PUSSYING OUT AND
THROWING IT TO THE WEB LIKE CNN.
>> John: THAT'S VERY BRAVE.
(MUMBLING)
John: ACTUALLY, YOU DIDN'T
GET THE LIST.
JUST TO CORRECT YOU THERE.
>> ALL RIGHT.
(FIRST ON THE LIST IS THE)
GUNSHOT).
>> OH, [BLEEP].
OH, COME ON.

THAT DART TOOK A WHILE TO GET TO
YOU.
>> TOOK A WHILE.
THAT STINGS.
>> John: ARE YOU OKAY?
I'M FINE, JOHN.
I'M FINE.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW LET ME JUST CHECK ONE THING.
ARE YOU A SEA HORSE?
>> John: NO, I'M NOT.
I'M NOT A SEA HORSE.
