HOWARD UNIVERSITY DOESN'T JUST
EDUCATE BLACK PEOPLE.
WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR BLACK
CORRESPONDENT LARRY WILMORE.
LARRY --
>> JON.
>> Jon: SENATOR RUN AND PAUL,
WHO I LIKE VERY MUCH.
HE SAID HIS FRIENDS ARE CALLING
HIM BRAVE OR CRAZY FOR SPEAKING
AT HOWARD.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BRAVE.
IT'S HOWARD UNIVERSITY NOT THE
APOLLO.
[LAUGHTER]
ALTHOUGH I DID THINK IT WAS A
NICE GESTURE FOR HIM TO GET A
JERRY CURL BEFORE COMING OVER.
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT A JERRY
CURL THAT'S WHAT HIS HAIR LOOKS
LIKE.
>> SERIOUSLY?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> AND HE GOES UP ON STAGE?
THEN HE IS BRAVE.
>> Jon: WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT HIS -- LET'S CALL IT TIME
SHARE PRESENTATION FOR THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> RIGHT.
WELL, IT'S TEMPTING, EXPWRON.
LET ME -- TEMPTING, JON.
LET'S BE HONEST BLACK PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN WITH THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY FOR 50 YEARS NOW.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A LITTLE
STRANGE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: THE REPUBLICANS ARE
NOT REALLY STRANGE.
YOU TAPPED THAT BEFORE.
>> WE TAPPED IT FOR 100 YEARS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
I KNOW ALL THEIR MOVES.
WE WERE IN LOVE ONCE?
YES.
PEOPLE CHANGE SO DO PARTIES.
>> Jon: IT SOUNDS LIKE THE
REPUBLICANS WOULD LIKE TO
REKINDLE THE RELATIONSHIP BY
REMINDING YOU OF THE GOOD TIMES
YOU SHARED.
>> RIGHT, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
GET BACK WITH SOMEONE.
IT'S FUN FOR A WHILE UNTIL YOU
REMEMBER THIS IS EXACTLY HOW YOU
FELT BEFORE YOU CAUGHT THEM IN
BED WITH THE DIXIE CRATS.
>> Jon: THE REPUBLICANS LEFT
BLACK AND NOW THEY WANT TO COME
BACK.
>> I LIKE THAT YOU TWISTED IT
AROUND.
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW THEY ARE
PRETENDING THEY DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING.
YOU CAN'T DISAPPEAR FOR 40 AND
50 YEARS AND SUDDENLY SASH YEAH
BACK TO ROSCOE'S CHICKEN AND
WAFFLES AND SAY, HEY, BABY PARTY
IN LINCOLN'S BED.
THAT'S SO OLD BROTHERS DON'T
EVEN DRIVE LINCOLNS.
>> Jon: DID YOU COMPARE THAT
TO ROSCOE'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES.
>> IT'S AN HISTORICALLY BLACK
MEAL.
>> Jon: TRUE.
>> HOW CAN WE TRUST THAT YOU'VE
CHANGED IF YOU ARE PRETENDING IT
WAS ALWAYS ALL GOOD.
>> Jon: I DON'T THINK THEY ARE
PRETENDING.
I THINK THEY BELIEVE IT.
>> BUT JON THIS IS SAY
REPUBLICAN COMMISSIONER IN
KANSAS TALKING ABOUT FIXING A
ROOF LAST WEEK, OKAY.
>> THE MISTAKE THAT COUNTY
COMMISSIONER JIM GUILE MADE
USING A RACIAL SLUR IN A
PREVIOUS COUNTY COMMISSION
MEETING.
HE WAS TALKING REPAIRG A ROOF
WHEN HE SAID.
>> I GUARANTEE IT WOULD BE THE
SAME IF YOU LET A (bleep).
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY?
>> AFRICAN-AMERICAN, ISN'T IT?
>> NO, HE SAID NIGGER RIGGING.
THEY WANT US BACK?
>> Jon: IS THAT BETTER OR
WORSE THAN REGULAR RIGGING?
I'VE NOT HEARD THAT.
>> I'M GOING TO GUESS IT'S
WORSE.
REPUBLICANS NEED TO ADMIT WE'RE
NOT DEALING WITH ACCIDENTAL
RACISM.
IF THE PAST 50 YEARS WERE THE
BRAD PAISLEY, LL COOL J LET BY
GONES BE BY GONES WE'VE WE'D
HAVE DONE WITH FOR THE TAX
