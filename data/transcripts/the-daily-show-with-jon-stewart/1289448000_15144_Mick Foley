>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT A WRESTLER FOR
TNA WRESTLING AND "THE DAILY
SHOW" SENIOR ASS KICKER.
HE'S A BEST SELLING AUTHOR WHOSE
NEW BOOK IS CALLED "COUNTDOWN TO
LOCKDOWN."
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
MICK FOLEY.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S REALLY YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT IS HAPPENING?
WE SHOULD EXPLAIN.
WE HAD A TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION
WHEN MICK WALKED OUT.
HIS MICROPHONE KNOCKED OFF.
WE DID IT AGAIN.
THE CROWD JUST AS SURPRISED TO
SEE YOU THE SECOND TIME.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHAT?
FOLEY, AGAIN?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HOW YOU BE, BROTHER.
>> I'M DOING GREAT.
I'M JUST STILL RECOVERING FROM
THAT HIGH OF THE RALLY.
IT WAS AN AMAZING TIME.
>> Jon: WE HAD A GREAT TIME.
WEAR IT WITH PRIDE, BABY.
IT'S ALL YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: YOU ARE SUCH AN
INTERESTING GUY TO ME.
FIRST OF ALL I LOVE THE BOOK.
THE BOOK IS CALLED "COUNTDOWN TO
LOCKDOWN."
YOUR NINTH BOOK.
>> INCLUDING THREE CHILDREN'S
BOOKS IT'S THE NINTH ONE.
>> Jon: THEY ARE VIOLENT
CHILDREN'S BOOKS.
THEY ADVOCATE VIOLENCE IN
CHILDREN.
[LAUGHTER]
NO.
YOU ARE SUCH AN INTERESTING GUY
BECAUSE YOUR ABILITY AS A WRITER
ARE SO -- IT FEELS EFFORTLESS
AND THE VERY REAL.
BUT YOU ARE THIS VERY FILL
TROPIC GUY.
YOU WORK WITH RAIN, RAPE ABUSE
NATIONAL NETWORK.
YOU DO INCREDIBLE WORK FOR THE
USO.
IN 1985 YOU WERE A LIFEGUARD FOR
MENTALLY CHALLENGED INDIVIDUALS.
>> I DID GET PAID FOR THAT JOB.
>> Jon: YOU GOT PAID BUT STILL
ALL THESE THINGS.
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THIS?
IS THIS AN EFFORT, IF I MAY, TO
BUILD UP SUCH A BACKLOG OF GOOD
KARMA THAT YOU CAN SPEND THE
REST OF YOUR TIME HITTING PEOPLE
WITH A BAT WRAPPED IN BARBED
WIRE?
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS, SIR?
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S AMAZING, WHAT DO YOU GET
FROM THAT?
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'VE ALWAYS
DONE?
>> THIS BOOK WAS IEW -- UNIQUE
TO ME.
I WAS ASKING IF THE WORLD REALLY
NEEDED A FOURTH MEMOIR.
NOW THAT I'VE SEEN THE BOOK
SALES, THE ANSWER WOULD APPEAR
TO BE NO.
>> Jon: THIS BOOK IS AWESOME,
BABY.
>> AS I WAS WRITING IT, IT WAS
INFLUENCED BY A UNIQUE PERSON
OF.
IT WAS A GIFT GIVEN TO ME.
I MADE THE DECISION TO DONATE
THE ENTIRE ADVANCE AND NOW THAT
I'VE SEEN THE SALES IT'S ALL OF
THE MONEY.
>> Jon: ALL OF PROCEEDS.
>>.
>> BUT FOR THE ASPIRING AUTHORS
WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT THEY
MIGHT WANT TO TELL THEIR WIFE
BEFORE SHE FINDS OUT BY READING
THE FLAP COVER.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THIS IS -- THAT IS TO
THE RAINN NETWORK.
50% GOES TO RAINN AND CHILD FUND
INTERNATION.
>> Jon: YOU ARE A GOOD DUDE.
NOTHING NOTHING BUT A GOOD DUDE.
VERY NICE.
HOW -- IN THE BOOK YOU TALK
ABOUT HOW I USED TO PLAY A TORI
AMOS SONG.
>> YES.
>> Jon: I'M GOING TO REPEAT
THAT QUICKLY YOU USED TO MY A
TORI AMOS SONG TO PSYCH YOURSELF
UP FOR CERTAIN MATCHES.
>> RIGHT.
UPON FURTHER REFLECTION.
THE FIRST CHAPTER IS CALLED
MEETING TORI AMOS KWROES.
I MET HER IN 2008.
IF ANY OF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
A 300 POUND MAN FLOATING LOOKS
LIKE.
>> Jon: YOU WERE THAT EXCITED?
>> I WAS REALLY TAKEN WITH HER.
I HAD NEVER BEEN ON THE COMPUTER
TO FIND TORI AMOS.
>> Jon: YOU FAMOUSLY WRITE
LONGHAND.
>> I DO WRITE LONGHAND.
I WENT ON AND LOGGED ON TO
RAINN.
LINKED IT.
I HAD KNOWN THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT,
RAPE WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM BUT
AS A GUY I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
SOMETHING I COULD HELP OUT WITH.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE A
DIFFERENCE HERE.
HOPEFULLY I'VE DONE THAT.
NOT ONLY WITH THE PROCEEDS OF
THE BOOK BUT I'M ALSO A
VOLUNTEER ONLINE.
I DON'T WANT TO STEREOTYPE YOUR
AUDIO BUT THEY ARE A CARING
GROUP OF PEOPLE, RIGHT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: I WOULD -- HOW DID THE
OTHER WRESTLERS REACT TO THE
FACT THAT YOU ARE PLAYING THE
SONG WINTER.
IS RICK FLAIR AT THE OTHER
LOCKER SAYING TRY SOME
MEGADEATH, MICK?
>> IT GAVE ME CONFIDENCE WITH
THE DANGEROUS MATCHES.
SOME OF THE STUFF I DID WAS FAR
FROM REASONABLE.
I COULD HAVE NEVER WORN THIS
METAL.
>> Jon: PHYSICALLY YOU DON'T
FOAL AS GIFTED BUT YOU MADE UP
FOR IT WITH FALLING FROM HIGHER
PLACES.
>> YES.
I COULD IN THE JUMP HIGH SO I
HAD TO JUMP FROM HIGH PLACES.
[LAUGHTER]
I KNOW THIS MAY SEEM OUT OF THE
BLUE BUT AS AN AUTHOR IS IT OKAY
IF I BLATANTLY PLUG A BOOK.
>> Jon: ABSOLUTELY.
>> NOT MINE.
THIS IS SAM BEE'S BOOK.
>> Jon: WHEN A PLUG FOR SAM
BEE'S BOOK?
>> SHE REALLY DID IT WITH THE
INSCRIPTION.
IT'S NOT JUST LIKE BEST OF LUCK.
>> Jon: SHE SIGNED IT TO YOU?
>> TONIGHT, JON, I'M GOING ON
THE RED EYE TOP LONDON AND THIS
IS NOT ONLY A GREAT BOOK BUT
ALSO A HANDY BONER SHIELD.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
READ AND COVER.
>> Jon: YOU REALLY JUST DON'T
KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO COME
FROM HERE.
MICK, IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO
SEE YOU.
I THINK THE WORLD OF YOU.
I HAVE SUCH GREAT RESPECT FOR
WHAT YOU DO.
KEEP WRITING AND DOING ALL THE
THINGS DO YOU.
IT'S ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
