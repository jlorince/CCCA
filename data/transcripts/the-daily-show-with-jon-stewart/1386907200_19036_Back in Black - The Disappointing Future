CONSTANTLY BEING TOLD THE FUTUREWAS GOING TO BE AWESOME.
I'D BE JUMPING OVER HELICOPTERSWITH MY JET PACK.
I'D HAVE GLASSES THAT WOULD LETME SEE THROUGH GIRLS' DRESSES
AND WE WOULD ALL HAVE FLYINGCARS THAT FOLD UP INTO A
BRIEFCASE.
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY CAR.
NOW IT'S JUST A THING THAT HOLDSMY CIGARETTES AND SEX TOYS AND
I'M ALL OUT OF CIGARETTES.
[LAUGHTER]IT'S 2013, YOU THINK WE WOULD BE
UP TO OUR NECKS IN AMAZINGTECHNOLOGY BUT INSTEAD THIS IS
APPARENTLY THE BEST WE CAN DO.

FLAT ON ITS FACE, I DON'T NEED AROBOT, ALL I NEED IS A FIFTH OF
SCOTCH, SOME MUSICAND A MIRROR.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT MAYBE THE BEST SIGN THAT
WE'RE DOING A CRAPPY JOB OFINNOVATING IS THE FACT THAT THIS
IS THE BIGGEST TECHNOLOGY STORYOF THE YEAR.
>> THESE ARE OCTOCOPTERS.
THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY DRONES BUTTHERE'S NO REASON THEY CAN'T BE
USED AS DELIVERY VEHICLES.
>> REALLY, BECAUSE I CAN THINKOF EIGHT RAZOR SHARP REASONS
THEY CAN'T BE USED AS DELIVERYVEHICLES.
OH, GOOD, MY NEW WAFFLE MAKER ISHERE.
OW!
MY HANDS.
[ LAUGHTER ]COME ON, TECHNOLOGY, THIS IS THE
FUTURE THAT SEVERAL DIFFERENTDOCTORS TOLD ME I WASN'T GOING
TO LIVE TO SEE.
GIVE ME SOMETHING WORTH WAITINGFOR.
>> SOME SAY IT'S A NEW BREED OFCRIME FIGHTING MACHINE.

>> TIRED OF WRITING THANK YOULETTERS, WHY NOT GET A ROBOT TO
DO IT FOR YOU.
>> PERFECT A ROBOT THAT DOESSOMETHING THAT PEOPLE STOPPED
DOING 30 YEARS AGO.

NEED THAT ROBOT TO WRITE ME ATHANK YOU NOTE AFTER ALL.
