>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE"THE DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE GOT A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
ONE OF OUR FAVORITE, ONE OF OURFAVORITES, BEEN WITH US FROM THE
BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM, ALLTHE WAY THROUGH, A YOUNG RICHARD
LEWIS WILL BE JOINING US ON THEPROGRAM.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SPEAKING OF RICHARD LEWSI, WHYDONT WE START THE SHOW WITH THE
OPPOSITE OF SAID RICHARD LEWIS.
THE POPE.
( LAUGHTER )
HE'S THE HEAD OF THE JEWISHCHURCH, POPE'S HEAD OF THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH.
THE  VICAR OF CHRIST, NUMBER ONEON GOD'S SPEED DIAL.
1.2 BILLION WORSHIPERS HANGINGON THE POPE'S EVERY WORD, AND
GUESS WHAT, THE WORD JUST CAMEDOWN.
>> POPE FRANCIS ISSUED A NEARLY200-PAGE DOCUMENT, CASTING
CLIMATE CHANGE AS A MORAL ISSUE,NOT SIMPLY A POLITICAL OR
ECONOMIC DEBATE.
>> Jon:  OH, BOY. OH, BOY.OH, BOY. OH, BOY!
A 200-PAGE--
( APPLAUSE )
200-PAGE ENCYCLICAL MORALTREATOISE CLIMATE CHANGE, AND
JUST IN TIME FOR BEACH SEASON!
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT A GREAT READ DOWN ATL.B.I., I HOPE IT'S IN THE
ORIGINAL LATIN.
THE POPE IS WEIGHING IN ON THESIDE OF TAKING ACTION AGAINST
CLIMATE CHANGE.
IT SEEMS A LITTLE ODD FOR THECATHOLIC CHURCH TO TAKE A
ENVIRONMENTAL STANCE -- ITHOUGHT BUDDHISM IS A RELIGION
OBSESSED WITH RECYCLING.
OH!
BOOM!
BOOM!
OH, SNAP!
NO, YOU DIDN'T!
OH, ( BLEEP ).
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHERE MY EIGHTFOLD PATH WALKERSAT!
THAT LINE DOESN'T USUALLY GET ATHE LOT OF ENTHUSIASM.
IT'S NOT TO SAY THE VATICAN ISBEING A POPEY-COME-LATELY TO
THIS.
THEY'VE RECOGNIZED CLIMATECHANGE FOR A LONG TIME.
>> THE VATICAN CLAIMS IT WASAMONG THE FIRST INSTITUTIONS TO
BELIEVE THAT GLOBAL WARMING ISCAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITY.
THE VATICAN'S PONTIFICAL ACADEMYOF SCIENCES WAS THE FIRST
EXCLUSIVE SCIENTIFIC ACADEMY INTHE WORLD.
AMONG ITS FIRST MEMBERS WASGALILEO GALILEI.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  I DON'T KNOW IFYOU REALLY WANT TO LIST GALILEO
AS ONE OF YOUR REFERENCES.
( LAUGHTER )
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH?
YEAH, I REMEMBER WORKINGWITH THEM.
THEY WERE LOVELY PEOPLE.
CONVICTED ME OF HERESEY ANDSENTENCED ME TO HOUSE ARREST
FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS OF MYLIFE.
OTHERWISE, VERY FORWARDTHINKING.
TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS MAGICHAND I'M TALKING INTO IT.
HERE IN THE AMERICA, THEREPUBLICAN PARTY HAS
TRADITIONALLY BEEN PRETTYPOPE-POPE.
( LAUGHTER )
PRETTY PRO-POPE.
SHARING AS THEY DO A YEARNINGFOR THE SIMPLER MORALITY OF
15th CENTURY.
BUT NOW THAT THE POPE HAS GONEROGUE, HOW THEY GONNA HANDLE IT?
>> JOE BARTON, THE SENIORREPUBLICAN ON THE ENERGY AND
COMMERCE COMMITTEE, SAYS HEDOESN'T CONSIDER THE POPE AN
EXPERT ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.
>> THE POPE SHOULD STAY WITH HISJOB AND LET US STAY WITH OURS.
>> Jon:  THAT IS HIS JOB.
IT'S THE BIGGEST JOB OF THE POPEIS TO TELL PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE
BEING BAD.
THAT'S WHY HE DRESSES LIKE A BIGWET BLANKET.
BARTON AND INHOFE, WHO CARESABOUT THOSE GUYS.
SANTORUM'LL BACK THE POP.
RICK SANTORUM WAS SO CATHOLIC,HE WAS AN ALTAR BOY UNTIL ABOUT
SIX WEEKS AGO.
HE'S SO CATHOLIC, HIS CRUCIFIXWEARS A CRUCIFIX.
>> I THINK THAT PROBABLY WE'REBETTER OFF LEAVING SCIENCE TO
THE SCIENTISTS AND FOCUSING ONWHAT WE DO-- WHAT WE'RE REALLY
GOOD AT, WHICH IS-- WHICH IS--WHICH IS THEOLOGY AND MORALITY.
>> Jon:  OH, YEAH, NO, JUSTLEAVE THE SCIENCE TO THE
SCIENTISTS.
BY THE WAY--
( LAUGHTER )
WHAT DO THE SCIENTISTS WHO HAVEAN OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS ABOUT
GLOBAL WARMING SAY ABOUT GLOBALWARMING?
EVEN REPUBLICAN UPONFRONT-RUNNER JEB BUSH IS CHAFING
AT THE POPE.
>> I DON'T GET ECONOMIC POLICYFROM MY-- FROM MY BISHOPS OR MY
CARDINALS OR FROM MY POPE.
I THINK RELIGION OUGHT TO BEABOUT MAKING US BETTER AS PEOPLE
AND LESS ABOUT THINGS THAT ENDUP GETTING INTO THE POLITICAL
REALM.
>> Jon:  YEAH, RELIGION ISABOUT MAKING US BETTER PEOPLE.
POLITICS IS ABOUT BRINGING OUTOUR WORST.
AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO KEEPTHOSE THINGS-- THIS IS WEIRD,
BECAUSE JEB SEEMS VERY IN FAVOROF CHURCH AND STATE AT LEAST AT
DATING LAST WEEK'S FREEDOMCOALITION.
>> OUR FAITH AND MORALTRADITIONS, IT IS REALLY THE
MORAL FOUNDATION OF OUR COUNTRY,THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON THE FACE
OF THE EARTH.
THIS CONSCIENCE SHOULD ALSO BERESPECTED WHEN PEOPLE OF FAITH
WANT TO TAKE A STAND FORTRADITIONAL MARRIAGE.
>> Jon:  OH, SO THERE IT'SOKAY.
PERHAPS MAYBE PEOPLE WOULD BEMORE FOR PREVENTING GLOBAL
WARMING IF WE REFERRED TO IT ASTAKING A STAND FOR PRESERVING
TRADITIONAL SEA LEVELS.
IT'S ADAM AND EVE.
NOT-- I THINK THAT WOULD WORK.
>> AS THE BIBLE SAYS, IT IS ADAMAND EVE NOT ADAM, NOT...
[JON MAKES GARGLING SOUNDS]
(LAUGHTER )
REPUBLICANS REACTING TOTHE POPE'S HONEST CALL FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESSWITH HOSTILITY IS NOT THE WAY TO
GO.
AND WHEN THE POPE LAYS DOWNTHE DOCTRINE LIKE THIS, THERE IS
ONLY ONE FORCE ON EARTHPOWERFUL ENOUGH TO SWAY HIM.
>> EXXON HAS SENT A SENIORLOBBYIST AND ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
OVER TO ROME.
>> EXXON HAS BEEN LOBBYING THEVATICAN OVER THE POPE'S CLIMATE
CHANGE MESSAGE.
>> Jon:  AH, THEY'VEAPPEALED TO A HIGHER AUTHORITY
THAN GOD.
( LAUGHTER )
AND SO IN THE-- IN THE WORDSOF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR, JESUS
CHRIST, DRILL, BABY, DRILL.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
