PHOTOJOURNALIST, HER NEW BOOK ISCALLED
"IT'S WHAT I DO: APHOTOGRAPHER'S LIFE OF LOVE AND
WAR," PLEASE WELCOME LYNSEYADDARIO! HELLO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
LYNSEY ADDARIO, THANK YOU FORBEING HERE!
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
>> Jon: "IT'S WHAT I DO," ALMOSTSOUNDS AS IF IT'S A RETORT TO
PEOPLE WHO SAY -- WHAT ARE YOUDOING!
>> I GUESS IT IS A RETORT.
I HAVE NO BETTER ANSWER.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE BEEN --WHENEVER SOMETHING DANGEROUS
HAS HAPPENED IN THE WORLD,YOU HAVE GRABBED YOUR CAMERA
AND YOU HAVE GONE THERE OVER THEPAST 20 YEARS?
>> 15.
>> Jon: 15 YEARS.
HOW HAS THAT CHANGED?
WE HAVE -- I WANT TO SHOWJUST SOME OF THE PICTURES
VERY QUICKLY OF SOME OF THEPLACES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN.
JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE.
THIS IS DARFUR.
>> 2004.
>> Jon: 2004. THIS IS, THE NEXTIS --
>> LIBYA.>> Jon: THIS IS LIBYA.
>> Jon: THE NEXT IS -- JUST TOGIVE YOU A SENSE.
THIS IS KORENGALVALLEY IN AFGHANISTAN.
>> AFGHANISTAN.
>> Jon: ALRIGHT, SO LET'S COMEBACK AND TALK.
YOU'RE NOT IN ANY OF THOSEPICTURES.
ARE YOU LYING TO US THAT YOUWERE THERE?
(LAUGHTER)>> YEAH, I ACTUALLY SENT MY
ASSISTANT TO TAKE THOSEPICTURES.
(LAUGHTER)I HAD A REMOTE AND I...
>> Jon: BUT THAT IS, THAT ISREMARKABLE, UNFETTERED,
UNPROTECTED ACCESS.
>> SURE, WHEN I'M WITH THE U.S.
MILITARY, I FEEL SOMEWHATPROTECTED.
BUT IN DARFUR, FOR EXAMPLE, WEWERE SNEAKING IN.
WE WENT TO CHAD AND HAD TO WALKABOUT A MILE IN AND MET UP WITH
THE REBELS AND JUST WALKEDAROUND. AND WE WERE LOOKING FOR
DISPLACED PEOPLE, WE WERELOOKING FOR BODIES,
BURNED VILLAGES, IT WAS AT THEBEGINNING OF THE WAR IN DARFUR.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
AND WHAT'S, WHAT'S SO INCREDIBLETO ME IS WITHOUT SOMEONE SUCH AS
YOURSELF AND REAL COURAGE THATYOU DISPLAY.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: WE DON'T KNOW ABOUTTHIS.
>> SURE.
I THINK THE ROLE OF JOURNALISTSIS FUNDAMENTAL.
AND THAT'S ONE THING PEOPLEOVERLOOK WHEN THEY LOOK AT ME
AND THEY SAY, WHY DO YOU DOTHIS?
AND I SAY TO THEM, WELL, WHERETO YOU GET YOUR NEWS?
DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A PHOTO IN THE"NEW YORK TIMES," THERE'S A
PHOTOGRAPHER TAKING THE PICTURE.
SO WITHOUT JOURNALISM, WEWOULD KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THESE PLACES.
>> Jon: AND IT IS, IT HAS BECOMEEVEN MORE THAN IT USED TO
BE, A DANGEROUS, DANGEROUS GAME.
>> IT HAS. I MEAN,WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH I.S.I.S.
WE'VE SEEN WITH JIM FOLEY,STEVEN SOTLOFF.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> ALL OF THESE JOURNALISTS WHOHAVE BEEN KILLED,
KIDNAPPED, THERE'S RANSOMINVOLVED.
>> Jon: AND YOU SPEAK ABOUT ITIN A COMPARTMENTALIZED WAY.
YOU HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED TWICE.
>> I HAVE. TWICE.
>> Jon: ONCE IN IRAQ.
>> IN IRAQ, IT WAS FOR A DAY, SOIT WAS SORT OF A DETENTION.
>> Jon: SURE. NO, THAT'S --
>> SURE. YOU KNOW, IT WAS --
>> Jon: THAT'S, IT'S ALMOST ADATE!
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT WAS LIKE, YOU KNOW, IDON'T KNOW, 11 HOURS WITH
15 GUNS TO MY HEAD,IT WAS ONLY A DAY. IT WAS FINE.
>> Jon: YEAH SURE, EASY PEASY!
>> BUT LIBYA WAS BAD. LIBYA WASALMOST A WEEK.
SO AND WE WERE BEATEN AND TIEDUP AND BLINDFOLDED AND
THREATENED WITHDEATH REPEATEDLY.
>> Jon: AND THESE GROUPS THATTAKE YOU -- YOU KNOW, YOU SPOKE
EARLIER TO ME ABOUT THIS IDEATHAT THESE SMALLER GROUPS START
NOW TO USE JOURNALISTS AS ALMOSTBAIT FISH TO SELL TO I.S.I.S. TO
SELL TO OTHER GROUPS, AND THAT'SBECOME THE ECONOMY IN THIS AREA.
>> WELL, I CAN'T, IT'S HARD FORME TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I DON'T
KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THEY'REGETTING THEIR MONEY,
BUT I DO KNOW THAT JOURNALISTSAND WHAT HAPPENS OFTEN
AND WHAT WAS HAPPENINGIN AFGHANISTAN AND WHAT I THINK
IS HAPPENING THERE ISTHAT JOURNALISTS GET TAKEN BY
SMALLER GROUPS, BANDITS,WHOEVER, AND EVENTUALLY THEY
GET TRADED UP TO MORE ORGANIZEDGROUPS WHO THEN IN TURN
TRY AND SELL US FOR RANSOM ORTRY TO BARTER
FOR PRISONER RELEASE.
SO IT'S A WHOLE SYSTEM.
>> Jon: IN THESE, ARE THERETHINGS THAT YOU SEE THAT ARE OUT
THERE THAT CAN BE DONE TOIN ANY WAY HELP SAFEGUARD
PEOPLE SUCH AS YOURSELF WHO HAVEA DESIRE TO BEAR WITNESS
THESE EVENTS,TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT TO
THE WORLD YET ARE IN SOMEWAYS HUNG OUT TO DRY A BIT?
>> WELL, IT'S HARD IN.
IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD, THEBEST THING WE CAN DO IS SHARE
INFORMATION AND SHARE, BASICALLYSHARE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE
THE PLAYERS ARE, WHERE IT'S SAFETO MOVE.
AND THAT SHOULD BE CONSTANTLYUPDATED.
WE NEED GOOD ACCESS TOTRANSLATORS AND DRIVERS.
NOW THEY'RE IN PESHMERGA INNORTHERN IRAQ, FOR EXAMPLE.
SO REALLY, THE BEST WAY TOSAFEGUARD YOURSELF
IS TO BE INFORMED.
AND WITHOUT THAT IT'SIMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T JUST ROAM INTO APLACE LIKE SYRIA OR ROAM AROUND
THE BORDERS OF SYRIA ANDEXPECT TO BE SAFE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
>> Jon: AND I IMAGINE NOW AS THENEWS ORGANIZATIONS PULL BACK AND
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ISN'T THEREFOR JOURNALISTS, IT BECOMES EVEN
MORE DIFFICULT.
>> SURE, BECAUSE INCREASINGLYPEOPLE ARE RELYING ON CITIZEN
JOURNALISTS WHICH THEY'RE NOTTRAINED JOURNALISTS.
NO ONE KNOWS WHO THEY ARE, WHERETHEIR LOYALTIES LIE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHETHER THEY'RESTAGING PICTURES.
SO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSEINCREASINGLY WE DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO THOSE PLACES.
>> Jon: WELL, I ALSO WANT TOSHOW, TOO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE SO
ACCUSTOMED TO THIS IDEA THATYOU'RE CAPTURING TRAGEDY.
BUT ALSO REAL TRIUMPH.
SHOW, SHOW THE -- SO THIS IS INAFGHANISTAN?
>> THIS IS DURING THE FALL OFTHE TALIBAN IN KANDAHAR IN 2001.
SO I WAS THERE WITH A GROUP OFTHE "NEW YORK TIMES."
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE BECAUSEIT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT
PEOPLE WERE GOING OUT, LISTENINGTO MUSIC ON THE STREETS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BECAUSE MUSIC WASBANNED UNDER THE TALIBAN.
AND I DO THINK, OF COURSE, FORTHESE MEN, THEY HADN'T SEEN A
WOMAN IN GOD KNOWS HOW LONG.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO WHENYOU SEE A WOMAN WITH A CAMERA,
THEY ALSO ALLCOMES TOWARDS THAT.
SO MAYBE CAUSED SOME OF THATPICTURE. YEAH.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: AND DREW THEM OUT.
BUT IT ALSO, WHAT I FIND SOIMPORTANT ABOUT THESE PICTURES
IS THEY CAPTURE A MOMENT BUTTHEY ALSO CREATE A PICTURE THAT
IS LAYERED.
GO TO THE NEXT ONE HERE.
AND UNEXPECTED. OKAY.
3-D MOVIE THEATER.
>> SO THIS IS IN IRAQ IN 2010.
AND I HADN'T BEEN BACK TO IRAQIN ABOUT SIX YEARS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC ASKEDME TO GO BACK AND, AND TO SHOW
THAT LIFE WAS COMINGBACK IN BAGHDAD.
AND I WAS ACTUALLY SHOCKED.
THERE WERE PEOPLE ON THESTREETS EVERYWHERE
AT ICE CREAM PARLORSAND MOVIE THEATERS LIKE THAT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND TO ME IT WAS SOINCREDIBLE.
>> Jon: HAVE YOU SEEN PEOPLE'SUNDERSTANDING OF THESE COUNTRIES
AND CULTURES AND CONFLICTS GROWWITH SOCIAL MEDIA, WITH
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, OR AREYOU SEEING IT NARROWING BECAUSE
WE'RE NO LONGER MAYBE GETTINGACCESS TO THESE PLACES?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
IT DEPENDS HOW LIKE WHETHER YOUTRUST THE SOURCES YOU'RE GETTING
THEM FROM, SO I'M NOT SURE.
I THINK, OF COURSE, THE MOREINFORMATION AND THE MORE IMAGES
WE GET OUT OF ANYWHEREIT HELPS TO CREATE AN IMAGE.
BECAUSE OFTEN WHENJOURNALISTS GO IN,
SOMETIMES WE'RE VERYFOCUSED ON THE WAR
OR JUST ONE STORY.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THERE'S AN ENTIRE LIFETHAT GOES ON THAT WE'RE NOT
SEEING.
AND SO THAT'S WHAT I ALSO FINDINTERESTING AS A JOURNALIST.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, THE STORY INBAGHDAD --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I LOVE THAT BECAUSEWE
WERE SEEING IMAGES OF FIGHTINGAND THE DESTRUCTION, BUT IT'S
FUN TO GO IN AND ACTUALLY FOCUSON SOMETHING TOTALLY UNRELATED.
>> Jon: RIGHT. WHICH IS WHY, TOTHAT POINT, AFTER READING THE
BOOK, WHICH IS FASCINATING ANDPHENOMENAL, I WANTED TO SHOW
THIS PICTURE.
THIS IS YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND.
I WANTED TO SHOW.
LOOK AT THAT.
SO JUST SO EVERYBODY KNOWS!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)LYNSEY ADDARIO GOES INTO
DARFUR AND AFGHANISTAN ANDSYRIA AND LIBYA AND GETS
PICTURES THAT NO ONE ELSE CANGET.
BUT YET, A FULLER PICTURE IS YOUHAVE A LIFE AND ARE A PERSON.
>> IT TOOK A LONG TIME. I DIDNOT HAVE A LIFE FOR A LONG TIME.
>> Jon: BUT IT'S WONDERFUL TOSEE AND I CONGRATULATE AND
I THANK YOU BECAUSE THISDOESN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT PEOPLE
SUCH AS YOURSELF ANDI'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
