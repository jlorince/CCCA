MEANWHILE, THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL BATON DEATH MARCH CONTINUES WITH RECENT PRIMARY
WINNER RICK SANTORUM STEPPING UP HIS ATTACK ON ONE --
>> PICK ANY OTHER REPUBLICAN IN THE COUNTRY, HE IS THE WORST REPUBLICAN IN THE COUNTRY TO PUT
UP AGAINST BARACK OBAMA.
>> Jon: THE WORST?
COME ON!
I CAN THINK OF PLENTY OF WORST.
THERE'S THAT MAYOR THAT RESPONDED TO ALLEGATIONS HIS POLICE FORCE WAS A TACKING THE
LATINOS LIKE THAT.
>> WHAT ARE YOU DO DOING FOR THE LATINO COMMUNITY TODAY?
>> I MIGHT HAVE TACK GROWS WHEN I GO HOME.
I'M NOT SURE YET.
>> Jon: WHAT YOU THINK OF MITT ROMNEY HE'S A STEP UP FROM THE TACO MAYOR.
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR IT WAS PRIMARILY MEANT IN ROMNEY'S RECORD ON HEALTH CARE.
IT WASN'T THE MOST ARTFUL PHRASING BUT YOU WOULD YOU HAVE TO GO OUT OF THE WAY TO
MISREPRESENT IT.
LET'S DO THAT.
>> YOU SAID MITT ROMNEY WAS THE WORE THE REPUBLICAN IN THE COUNTRY.
>> WHAT SPEECH DID YOU LISTEN TO?
>> RIGHT HERE.
>> STOP LYING.
I SAID HE WAS THE WORST REPUBLICAN TO RUN ON THE ISSUE OF OBAMACARE AND THAT'S WHAT I
WAS TALKING ABOUT.
>> Jon: ARRRHG.
I'M ANGRY.
AGGGRRR.
I KIND OF LIKE GUY WITH A LITTLE FIRE IN HIS BELLY.
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO PUSH TIGHT FAR, RIGHT, RICK?
>> TO RUN AGAINST THE BARACK OBAMA ON THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE.
I'VE BEEN SAYING IT IN EVERY SPEECH QUIT DISTORTING MY WORDS.
IF I SEE IT, IT'S (bleep).
>> Jon: I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.
RICK SANTORUM A CONSERVATIVE SWEARING AT A REPORTER.
I THINK THIS IS HOW HE SHOULD TALK FROM NOW ON.
I BELIEVE LIFE BEGINS AT (bleep) CONCEPTION.
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT (bleep).
BOOM!
[ LAUGHTER ]
ARRRRGGGHH,.
I JUST WANTED TO SEE THE SHOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
TICKETS WERE FREE BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE AN EYE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK THE REAL SANTORUM MIGHT BE MORE BAD ASS THAN WE REALIZE.
HE LOOKS ALL MILQUETOASTY IN THE SWEATER VESTS BUT I THINK THEY STARTED OUT AS SWEATERS AND HE
RIPS THE ARMS OFF!
[ LAUGHTER ]
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS UPSET.
IT'S A GOTCHA QUESTION.
THE PRESS CAN GET GOTCHAY.
WATCH THIS EXCHANGE BETWEEN WOLF BLITZER AND MITT ROMNEY.
>> MY DAD GETTING R AND R THIS WEEKEND AT THE MOVIES TODAY WITH ME AND MY KIDS.
YOU WENT TO SEE THE HUNGER GAMES.
HOW DID YOU LIKE THAT?
>> Jon: WOW, THAT'S THE KIND OF QUESTION YOU ASK A CHAIR.
SERIOUSLY EASY QUESTION THOUGH,
RIGHT.
IT'S ROMNEY.
YOU NEVER KNOW IF HE'S GO TO GO I LOVED IT, HATED.
GO THUMBS UP AND DOWN.
>> IT WAS NICE TO SEE A FLICK FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME.
>> PG-13, IS IT A LITTLE TOO VIOLENT FOR YOUNG KIDS?
>> THIS WHOLE THING WAS A SETUP TO NAIL ROMNEY ON THE HOT BUTTON
ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT HE IS A RESPONSIBLE GRANDPA.
MR. ROMNEY YOUR MUG SAYS WORLD'S GREATEST GRANDPA THE BUT THE FACTS SAY OTHERWISE.
DUDE, IT WAS A PG-13 MOVIE NOT A RAVE.
>> I THINK IT'S DISTURBING FOR YOUNG KIDS.
THE PG-13 IS AN INDICATION OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE FILM BUT I'M OVER 13 NOW.
>> Jon: BOOM.
IT WAS FUNNY.
NICELY DONE.
YOU MADE A JOKE AND PREVENTED WOLF BLITZER FROM PROVING YOU ARE UNDER 13 AND INELIGIBLE FOR
THE PRESIDENT SIX HOPEFULLY THAT SETTLES GRANDPA GATE.
>> I'M OVER 13 NOW.
BUT YOU WENT WITH YOUNG KIDS,
RIGHT?
>> YOU FEEL BAD THAT MORMONS CAN'T CURSE BECAUSE IF ANYTHING
