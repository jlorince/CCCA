>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, MILD-MANNERED
ECONOMIST BRUCE BARTLETT.
YOU KNOW HIM AS THE INCREDIBLE
HULK.
BRUCE BANNER.
I APOLOGIZE.
NOW DIONNE WARWICK IS
VERYANGARY.
FOLKS, TONIGHT IN ARIZONA AS WE
SPEAK, BEFORE REMAINING
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES MET IN THE PEN
PENULTIMATE DEBATE OF THIS
ELECTION SEASON, TONIGHT, TWO OF
THEM WERE CARD OFF BY BANDITOS
ND ONE WAS SWALLOWED BY AOSA
SNAKE.
I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE.
( APPLAUSE )
ACTUALLY WE DO.
I BELIEVE THAT'S CLEARLY NEWT
GINGRICH'S HEAD.
ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE DEBATE WE
TAPED BEFORE THE DEBATE.
BUT I DO KNOW THIS-- NOTE MATTER
WHAT ISSUES THEY DISCUSSED,
WHETHER SATAN'S INFLUENCE ON THE
DECARE OF OUR CULTURE, OR HOW
SATAN RECENTLY JACKED THE PRICE
OF GAS UP, OR HOW SATAN DECIDED
THIS WOULD BE THE LAST SEASON OF
"CHUCK."
I ASSUMA THAT WAS SATAN BECAUSE
WHO ELSE WOULD CANCEL "CHUCK."
THIS ELECTION OF 2012 IS ALL
THAT STANDS BETWEEN AMERICA
ANDICAA TAFT FEE, JUST AS WE
WERE WARNED, THE CONSEQUENCES IN
2008 COULD BE DIRE.
>> IF MR. OBAMA SHOULD BECOME
PRESIDENTISH REALLY BELIEVE IT
WILL BE HARD TO STOP THE ECONOMY
FROM BEING SOCIALIZED.
>>SOCIALIZED.
>> Jon:  SOCIALIZED ECONOMY!
IF OBAMA WAS ELECTED IN 2008.
WE WERE WARNED.
AND, INDEED, BARACK OBAMA DID
TAKE BILLIONS OF TAXPAYER
DOLLARS AND REDISTRIBUTE THEM...
TO THE BANKS.
( LAUGHTER )
SO IT'S KIND OF SOCIALISM, IN A
DYSLEXIC...
( LAUGHTER )
AND WHAT OF OUR ENEMIES ABROAD?
>> I WILL TELL YOU IF HE IS
ELECTED PRESIDENT, THEN THE
RADICAL ISLAMISTS, THE AL QAEDA
AND THE RADICAL ISLAMISTS AND
THEIR SUPPORTERS, WILL BE
DANCING IN THE STREETS.
>> Jon:  TALK ABOUT-- TALK
ABOUT HITTING THE NAIL ON THE
HEAD.
IF YOU WERE TO REPLACE THE WORD
"DANCING" WITH THE PHRASE,
"DONNELLING UNMANNED DRONE
MISSILES RAINING HELL FIRE FROM
THE SKY."
SO TWO FOR TWO.
( APPLAUSE )
AND BY THE WAY, IN 2008, THERE
WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING...
( LAUGHTER )
ALLAH WE DID WAS ADD A
( BLEEP ).
IN 2008, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
NOTHING YOU COULD DO TO DEFEND
YOURSELF AGAINST THE SOCIALIST
ISLAMIST TAKEOVER BECAUSE THE
DICTATOR HAD THOUGHT THINGS
THROUGH.
>> IF EITHER SENATOR CLINTON OR
SENATOR OBAMA IS ELECTED
PRESIDENT, THE RIGHTS OF
LAW-ABIDING GUN OWNERS WILL BE
AT RISK, MY FRIENDS, AND HAVE NO
DOUBT ABOUT IT.
>> Jon:  NO DOUBT ABOUT IT!
( LAUGHTER )
AND WHILE THE ONLY SECOND
AMENDMENT MEASURES OBAMA ENDED
UP SIGNING ALLOWED CITIZENS TO
CARRY CONCEALED WEAPONS INTO
NATIONAL PARKS AND ON TO AMTRAK
TRAINS, WHICH MAKES SENSE--
( LAUGHTER )
BECAUSE WHO BETTER TO BE ARMED
THAN ANGRY LATE PEOPLE IN
CONFINED SPACES?
THE POINT IS, EVEN THOUGH OBAMA
HAS NOT TAKEN YOUR GUNS, IN
HINDSIGHT, THERE IS NO DOUBT
THAT HE HAS...
( LAUGHTER )
SEE, IT APPEARS BARACK OBAMA HAS
FAILED TO KEEP MANY OF THE
CAMPAIGN PROMISES THAT HIS
OPPONENTS MADE FOR HIM.
( LAUGHTER )
INCLUDING, THE INCREDIBLY
SPECIFIC ONES--
>> HE'S GOING TO HAVE AN EFFORT
TO ELIMINATE FREEDOM OF SPEECH
FOR RUSH LIMBAUGH AND SEAN
HANNITY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  IT'S A SHAME THAT
NEWT GINGRICH NEVER GOT TO LIVE
TO SEE THAT DREAM REALIZED
BECAUSE AS WE SAID TONIGHT, IN
ARIZONA, NEWT GINGRICH SWALLOWED
WHOLE BY WHAT ANY OBSERVER WOULD
CONSIDER TO BE A VERY AMBESHES
SNAKE.
( LAUGHTER
