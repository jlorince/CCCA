THAT QUICK.
ACTUALLY, RUSSIA IS NOT ONLY
GLOBAL LEADERSHIP STORY WE'RE
DEALING WITH TONIGHT WHICH BRINS
US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT...
INDEED.
NOW, WE'VE ALREADY DEALT WITH
RUSSIA, SO LET'S SEE WHERE OUR
MAGICAL DPLOAB WILL TAKE US NEXT
EGYPT!
EGYPT.
I JUST LIFT EGYPT.
I'M NOT-- I'M NOT USED TO GUNS.
( LAUGHTER )
AS THE SITUATION IN EGYPT
CONTINUES TO DEVOLVE, THE U.S.
LIKE A POLAR BEAR ON A HASTILY
MELTING GLACKIER IS TRYING TO
ACT LIKE EVERYTHING'S STILL
COOL.
( LAUGHTER )
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, WE
DISCUSSED HOW, DUE TO AN
UNHELPFUL U.S. LAW WE ARE UNABLE
TO CALL THE EGYPTIAN MILITARY
TAKEOVER OF THEIR GOVERNMENT A
COUP BECAUSE IF WE UTTER THE
DIPLOMATICALLY OFFENSIVE "C"
WORD WE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE
TO SEND EGYPT AID, OUR ONLY
NONMISSILE-BASED MOVE.
DON'T WORRY.
SINCE THEN WE'VE COME UP WITH AN
INGENIOUS SOLUTION.
>> LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE US TO
MAKE A FORMAL DETERMINATION.
THAT IS A REVIEW WE HAVE
UNDERGONE, AS TO WHETHER COUP
TOOK PLACE AND IT IS NOT IN OUR
NATIONAL INTEREST TO MAKE SUCH A
DETERMINATION.
>> John: YSHES BECAUSE YOU
FORGOT.
OUR OTHER.
ILOMATIC MOVE.
THE LAW SAYS WE HAVE TO CUT OFF
AID IF THERE IS A COUP, BUT IT
DOESN'T SAY WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
A COUP IS.
IGNORANCE AND DIPLOMATIC BLISS.
CLEARLY, THIS IS A VERY DELICATE
SITUATION, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND
LINGUISTICALLY, AND THAT ISçó WHYñr
THE WHITEH%USE DISPATCHED ITS
"A" TEAM.
>> REPUBLICANS JOHN McCAIN AND
LINDSEY GRAHAM THROUGH TO CAIRO
AT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RIDICULOUS.
>> John: I'M SORRY, DID I SAY
DISPATCHED THEIR "A" TEAM?
THEY DISPATCHED A TEAM.
( APPLAUSE ).
LET'S BE FAIR, THESE ARE TWO
VERY SEASONED POLITICIANS.
ALL THEY REALLY HAVE TO DO IS
NOT SAY THE WORD "COUP."
>> THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE
FORMER GOVERNMENT PRESIDENT'S
REMOVAL WERE A COUP.
