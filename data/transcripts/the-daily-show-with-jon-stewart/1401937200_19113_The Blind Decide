[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> JON: WELCOME BACK.
YOU KNOW WITH THE 2014 MIDTERMSON THE HORIZON, FEEL THE
EXCITEMENT IN THE ROOM.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE MORE CERTAINTHAN EVER IN THEIR DOCTRINES.
CUTTING TAXES CREATES JOBS.
HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT KILLSJOBS.
MARRIAGE IS BETWEEN A MAN AND AWOMAN.
MONEY IS SPEECH.
GUNS ARE A GO TO ACCESSORY FORANY OUTFIT.
[LAUGHING]>> JON: THEY MAKE A LOVELY
COUPLE.
IT'S A STRATEGY THAT HASDIFFICULTIES WHEN TRYING TO
APPEAL TO MODERATEVOTERS THOUGH WHO MAY VALUE
THINGS LIKE EVIDENCE.AS OPPOSED TO THE BASE
WHO BELIEVE "ANGLES IN THEOUTFIELD" IS A DOCUMENTARY.
NOT EVERY CANDIDATE CAN BRIDGETHAT GAP.
LIKE MICHELLE BACHMAN. SHE CAMEOUT FORCEFULLY AGAINST THE HPV
VACCINE BECAUSE AS SHESTATED IT CAUSES BRAIN DAMAGE.
>> I AM NOT A DOCTOR, I'M NOT ASCIENTIST. I'M NOT A PHYSICIAN.
ALL I WAS DOING WAS REPORTINGWHAT THIS WOMAN TOLD
ME LAST NIGHT AT THE DEBATE.
>> JON: IF WE CAN'T MAKE LAWSBASED ON WHAT SOME LADY TELLS
YOU AT A DEBATE, I GUESS THENAZIS HAVE WON.
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT AS --[ APPLAUSE ]
>> JON: YA.
OUT OF CONTEXT, THE AUDIENCEAPPLAUDING THE NAZIS HAVE WON
IS GOING TO SEEM A LITTLE WEIRD.
OR PERHAPS WHEN ILLINOISREPRESENTATIVE JOHN SHIMKUS
ARGUED WITH CERTAINTY A GREATPLACE FOR OUR NATION'S NUCLEAR
WASTE WOULD NOT  BE NEARILLINOIS.
>> A MOUNTAIN IN A DESSERT IS ASUITABLE PLACE TO PUT HIGH LEVEL
NUCLEAR WASTE.
I BELIEVE IT IS.
BUT, I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.
>> JON: BUT, THERE I GO.
I'M NOT A THEME PARK EXPERTEITHER.
I ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE A GREATPLACE FOR A TOXIC WASTE FAMILY
FUN ZONE.
BUT, THERE IS ONE THING, ONETHING THE GOP IS SUPER, SUPER,
SUPER SURE ABOUT.
AND, IT'S THAT CLIMATECHANGE IS NOT REAL. ANDEVEN IF IT WAS REAL
WE SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING.IN FACT STALLING AND BLOCKING
CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATIONAT EVERY TURN IS WHAT THEY DO.
LIKE THIS WEEK WHEN THEENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
RELEASED LONG AWAITEDGUIDLINES AIMED TO REDUCE CARBON
POLLUTION BY 30%. CUE THEREPUBLICAN'S TOP CLIMATOLOGIST.
>> EVERY PROPOSAL THAT HASCOME OUT OF THIS
ADMINISTRATION TO DEAL WITHCLIMATE CHANGE INVOLVES HURTING
THE ECONOMY AND KILLINGAMERICAN JOBS. THAT CAN'T BE THE
PRESCRIPTION FOR DEALING WITHCHANGES IN OUR CLIMATE.
>> HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNERSAID THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN IS
NUTS.
>> JON: BONKERS.
THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN IS [BEEP]KNUCKLEHEADED.
THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN IS  BLAH,BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!
[LAUGHING]>> JON: AND HE SHOULD KNOW.
THIS MAN HAS A VERY IMPRESSIVESET OF SCIENTIFIC CREDENTIALS.
SUCH AS.
>> I'M NOT QUALIFIED TO DEBATETHE SCIENCE OVER CLIMATE CHANGE.
>> JON: THEN WHY DO YOU? EVENTHOUGH --
[ APPLAUSE ]>> JON: -- EVEN THOUGH HE ONLY
HAS A BA IN GUT FEELINGS IT'SNOT LIKE THAT LACK OF
QUALIFICATION HAS STOPPED HIMFROM HAVING THAT DEBATE.
>> WHAT IS THE REPUBLICAN PLANTO DEAL WITH CARBON EMISSION
WHICH EVERY SCIENTIFICORGANIZATION HAS SAID IT'S
CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE?
>> GEORGE THE IDEA THAT CARBONDIOXIDE IS A CARCINOGEN THAT'S
HARMFUL TO OUR ENVIRONMENT ISALMOST COMICAL.
EVERY TIME WE EXHALE WE EXHALECARBON DIOXIDE.
>> JON: YES.
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH CARBONDIOXIDE.
THAT'S WHY I KEPT MY PET HAMSTERIN A BOX WITH NO HOLES IN IT.
HE'S DOING GREAT.
HE'S BEEN ASLEEP FOR THREEYEARS.
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME CURRENTSTORY WHERE REPUBLICANS HAD
ACTUAL EXPERTISE LIKE ON THEBIRHDAHL TALIBAN PRISON SWAP --
>> EARLIER TODAY PRESIDENT OBAMADEFENDED THE PRISONER SWAP.
HERE TO RESPOND, FOX NEWSMILITARY ANALYST AND WAR STORIES
HOST, OUR FRIEND COLONEL OLIVERNORTH.
>> I KNOW A LOT ABOUTHOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS.
>> JON: YOU'RE NOT [BEEP]KIDDING. THAT'S FORMER NATIONAL
SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBEROLIVER IRAN CONTRA NORTH
ENGAGING IN WHAT WE IN THEBUSINESS CALL UNDERSTATEMENT.
A MAN WHO BACK IN THE REAGANADMINISTRATION GAINED A GREAT
DEAL OF HANDS-ON TERRORISTNEGOTIATING EXPERIENCE WHEN HE
HELPED TRADE 2000 MISSILES TOTHE COUNTRY IRAN FOR HELP IN
TRYING TO FREE 7 AMERICANS BEINGHELD IN LEBANON AND THEN USED
THE MONEY FROM THAT MISSLE SALETO FUND NICARAGUAN CONTRAS OR AS
THEY WERE SOMETIMES REFERED TOCOKE-FUELED JUNGLE DEATH SQUADS.
WHAT WOULD THIS INDIVIDUAL THINKOF THE BERGDAHL DEAL?
>> WAS A RANSOM WAS PAID TOTHE HAQQANI'S? IF A RANSOM WAS
PAID EITHER AT OUR BEHEFT ORWITH AMERICAN TAX DOLLARS
IT MEANS THIS GOVERNMENT ISCAUSING TO BE FUNDED A CRIMINAL
ENTERPRISE THAT KILLSAMERICANS. THE HAQQANIS.
>> JON: SO, YOU ARE SAYING ITNOW LIKE IT'S A BAD THING.
DOES IT MAKE YOU MAD BECAUSEIT'S GONE MAINSTREAM?
I WAS INTO USING AMERICANTAXPAYER MONEY TO ARM TERRORIST
GROUPS WAY BEFORE IT WAS COOL.BUT AS ALWAYS,
COLONEL NORTH MAKES THE ARGUMENTTHAT THE REAL TRAGEDY HERE IS
THE TRANSPARENCY.
>> IT'S A DISASTER THE WAY THISHAS ALL COME OUT.
THE REALITY IS THEY NEVER TALKABOUT IT.
RONALD REAGAN DIDN'T AND THISGUY SHOULDN'T OF DONE IT.
>> JON: FINALLY SOME PRACTICALADVICE FROM AN INFORMED VOICE ON
THE RIGHT. YOU CAN OVER STEPYOUR AUTHORITY JUST LIE
THE [BEEP] OUT OF IT AFTERWARDS.
THAT'S THE MORE YOU DON'TACTUALLY KNOW.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
