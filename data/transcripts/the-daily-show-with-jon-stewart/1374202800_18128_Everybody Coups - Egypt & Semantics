MUSLIM.
OF COURSE WHAT NEITHER OF
THOSE SIDES UNDERSTAND HERE
IS THAT AMERICA'S GOVERNMENT
DOESN'T ESPECIALLY CARE
WHOSE'S RUNNING EGYPT AS
LONG AS WE HAVE INFLUENCE
WITH THEM.
THAT IS WHY WE SEND THEM 1.6
BILLION DOLLARS IN AID EACH
YEAR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
BY THE WAY, WE SEND EGYPT
1.6 BILLION DOLLARS IN AID
EACH YEAR.
AND WE DO NOT WANT TO STOP
DOING THAT.
THEY'RE A VITAL ALLY FOR
NEWS THAT PART OF THE WORLD.
IN FACT, I ACTUALLY HAVE
NEXT YEAR'S MONEY RIGHT HERE,
WHICH-- WHICH WE BADLY WANT
TO BRIBE EGYPT W I MEAN HELP
THEM WITH, BRIBE, HELP, IT'S
A GRAY AREA.
THE POINT IS, WHO SHOULD I
MAKE THIS COMICALLY
OVERSIZED NOVELTY CHECK OUT
TO.
>> U.S. LAW, THE FOREIGN
ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961
EXPLICITLY SAYS THE
ADMINISTRATION CANNOT
FINANCIALLY SUPPORT AN ARMY
THAT IS INVOLVED IN A
MILITARY COUP.
>> WHAT?
SO NOW WE CAN'T EVEN GIVE
EGYPT MONEY?
(LAUGHTER)
THROWING MONEY AT THE
PROBLEM HAS LONG BEEN THE
BACKBONE OF AMERICA'S
FOREIGN POLICY.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS.
THIS IS NOT GOOD NEWS.
THAT WE ARE PREVENTED FROM
OUR OWN LAWS FROM GIVING
STRATEGICALLY ALLIES ANY
SORPT OF COUP AID.
>> OH, GOD, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO.
NO, NO!
I CLEARLY SAID COUP AID, NOT
COOL AID, ARE YOU PAYING FOR
THAT WALL.
SO IT LOOKS LIKE-- IT LOOKS
LIKE WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE.
BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP
GIVING EGYPT MONEY.
BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY DENY
THAT THIS WAS A COUP, RIGHT?
>> THE LEGAL DETERMINATION
THAT A COUP HAPPENED WOULD
REQUIRE A SUSPENSION OR
CUTTOFF IN ALL
NONHUMANITARIAN ASSISTANT
DANCE TO EGYPT INCLUDING ITS
1.3 BILLION IN FMF IS THAT
CORRECT?
>> WELL, MATT, BECAUSE WE'RE
NOTS THERE, WE HAVEN'T MADE
THAT DETERMINATION.
>> I KNOW, BUT THAT
DETERMINATION WOULD TRIGGER
A CUTTOFF OR SUSPENSION OF
THE ASSISTANCE IS THAT
CORRECT?
>> AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO BE
ANALYZING WHAT THE LEGAL
OPTIONS ARE HERE.
THAT IS BEING CLOSELY LOOKED
AT.
>> SO THAT IS OUR STRATEGY.
WE THINK WE CAN GET AROUND
OUR OWN COUP RULE IF WE CAN
JUST MANAGE TO NOT USE THE
WORD COUP.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S LIKE A GAME SHOW.
YOUR CHALLENGE IS TO
DESCRIBE THE EVENTS IN EGYPT
BUT IF YOU SAY THE WORD COUP,
WILL YOU LOSE EVERYTHING.
IT'S LIKE THE 100,000 DOLLAR
PYRAMID EXCEPT IT'S 1.6
BILLION DOLLARS AND THE
PYRAMID IS AN ACTUAL
PYRAMID.
(LAUGHTER)
SO LET'S DO THIS, LET'S DO
THIS!
LET'S PLAY!
HERE'S OUR FIRST CONTESTANT,
STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN
JENNIFER SAKI, LET'S GO.
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
FACTORS BEING CLOSELY LOOKED
AT.
THERE IS A BROAD LEGAL
DEFINITION THAT IS
APPLICABLE IN MANY CASES.
A WIDE-RANGING, HIGH LEVEL
INTERAGENCY PROCESS
DETERMINING THE NEXT STEPS
ON OUR POLICY FOR EGYPT.
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
ON ITS GROUND WHO DO NOT
THINK IT WAS A COUP.
>> WOW.
SHE IS GOOD.
SHE IS GOING KAMA SUTRA ON
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE,
BENDING WORDS INTO ALL KINDS
OF EXCITING EXOTIC POSITIONS
BEFORE REACHING A CLIMAX OF
MEANINGLESSNESS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WILL YOU LET US KNOW WHEN
THE HEAT FROM THE FLAMES OF
THE BURNING HOOPS THAT YOU
ARE JUMPING THROUGH TO AVOID
TAKING A POSITION ON THIS
GET TOO HOT, OR WILL THAT
JUST BE OBVIOUS FROM --
>> MATT, IF YOU ARE HAVING A
GOOD TIME TODAY I WILL BE
BACK HERE TOMORROW.
WE'LL DO THIS AGAIN.
>> OH, THOSE TWO ARE GOING
TO [BLEEP] LIKE RABBITS WHEN
THEY GET HOME.
THAT'S A FACT.
(APPLAUSE)
>> OUR NEXT CONTESTANTS IN
THE 1.6 BILLION DOLLAR
PYRAMID IS WHITE HOUSE PRESS
SECRETARY JAY CARNEY WHO
SOMEHOW TRIES TO BE
UNEQUIVOCAL IN HIS
EQUIVICATION.
>> IN ANSWER TO YOUR
QUESTION, SPECIFICALLY ABOUT
WHAT WE CALL WHAT HAPPENED,
I'LL BE BLUNT.
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY
COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT
SITUATION.
I'M TRYING TO BE VERY CANDID,
IS THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX
SITUATION.
>> I'M BEING VERY CLEAR WITH
YOU AND NEDRA AND EVERYONE
HERE THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX
AND DIFFICULT ISSUE.
AND AGAIN I'M TRYING TO BE
CANDID HERE ABOUT, YOU'LL
GET NO ARGUMENT FROM ME IF
YOU GO ON THE AIR AND SAY
THAT THIS IS A HIGHLY
COMPLICATED SITUATION.
>> THAT POOR MAN.
I HONESTLY CANNOT TELL IF
HE'S DOING A TERRIBLE JOB OR
JUST HAS A TERRIBLE JOB.
(LAUGHTER)
>> I THINK IT MIGHT BE 100
PERCENT OF BOTH.
THE LOGIC OF THIS SITUATION
IS INSANE.
IT'S AS IF KATE MIDDLETON
GAVE BIRTH BUT ENGLISH LAW
PREVENTED HER FROM CALLING
THE THING SHE WAS HOLDING A
BABY.
YES, THIS TINY HUMAN EMERGED
FROM MY WOMB AFTER NINE
MONTHS OF GESTATION BUT IS
IT A BABY, I DON'T THINK WE
SHOULD GET BOGGED DOWN IN
CALLING IT THAT QUITE YET.
THE PROBLEM IS, WE CAN TRY
TO PARS WORDS ON THIS ALL WE
WANT.
WE CAN CALL THIS A MORSIECTOMY,
A SURGICAL REMOVAL OF A MAN
FROM THE BODY OF THE COUNTRY
HE WAS HURTING.
BUT EVERYONE IS GOING TO
KNOW WHAT WE'RE SAYING.
LET'S BE CLEAR HERE, WE CAN
DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED IN
EGYPT AS A COMPLICATED AND
MULTIFACETED SITUATION, BUT
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THAT IS
JUST A FANCY LEGAL WAY TO
AVOID CALLING IT WHAT IT IS,
A COMPLETE CLUSTER [BLEEP].
(LAUGHTER)
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
