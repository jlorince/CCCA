NO, NO!
I WILL TURN THE PROGRAM OVER NOW
TO SOMEONE WHOSE ACCENT MAKES
YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN TRUST HIM,
JOHN OLIVER.
JOHN?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, JON.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THANK YOU, JON, AND PLEASE,
PLEASE, BEFORE I CONTINUE, LET
ME ASSURE MY VIEWERS THAT FROM
NOW ON THERE WILL BE NO
PUSSSYING OUT.
NO OFFENSE.
I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO RIP
ANTHONY WEINER A NEW ASS (BLEEP)
(BLEEP).
AN (BLEEP) THAT EVEN HE WOULD
NOT TEXT A PICTURE OF.
WHY?
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SO BIG IT
WON'T FIT WITHIN TWITTER'S
140-CHARACTER LIMIT.
THAT SLEAZY McJEWFRO WILL GET
NO QUARTER FROM ME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WE'RE... WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE CONGRESSMAN, RIGHT?
>> OH, YES, YES.
OKAY, NO PROBLEM, YEAH.
JON, I WILL HOUND HIM, I WILL
MOCK HIM UNTIL HIS SHAME IS
VISIBLE.
A BULGE STRAINING AGAINST A
FABRIC OF HIS BEING, BEGGING TO
BE RELEASED.
BUT THIS TIME, WEINER, THERE
WILL BE NO HAPPY ENDING.
(LAUGHTER)
AND AS FOR YOU, STEWART, AND
YOUR VIVIDLY, VIVIDLY INJURED
HAND, THAT'S A GENUINE PROBLEM,
THAT'S A GENUINE PROBLEM.
THAT'S...
(APPLAUSE).
(BLEEP).
>> Jon: YUP.
WE BETTER HURRY UP AND (BLEEP)
BECAUSE I AM BLEEDING OUT MOTHER
(BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER).
>> JON, TALK TO THIS, HE CAN
SWAB HIMSELF DOWN.
YOU'RE FINE, YOU'RE FINE.
(LAUGHTER)
DON'T BE SO JEWISH ABOUT IT,
YOU'RE FINE.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU'RE FINE.
YOU'RE FINE.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY FINE.
IT'S A NICK.
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: I SHOULD BE CATHOLIC.
I SHOULD TURN IT INTO A DRINK?
(LAUGHTER)
>> IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
THE POINT IS, JOHN, I WOULD
RECOMMEND YOU TO GROW A PAIR,
TAKE A PICTURE OF THAT PAIR, AND
TEXT IT TO YOURSELF TO REMIND
YOURSELF WHAT BALLS LOOK LIKE.
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO DRY
YOUR EYES, TURN OFF YOUR SOUL,
AND GIVE THIS AUDIENCE THE
PREPUBESCENT (BLEEP) JOKES THEY
WAITED OUTSIDE IN 90-DEGREE
TEMPERATURES FOR AND YOU FAILED,
JON!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WELL, NO MORE!
NO MORE, JON!
NO LONGER!
SCRUB YOURSELF DOWN!
CLEAR EYES, DEAD
