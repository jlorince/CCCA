SHOW".  MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD ONE TONIGHT.
A WHOLE SHOW WE PLANNED OUT.
LIAM NEESON, VERY TALL MAN, ISJOINING US.
HE'S AN ACTOR.
I WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT AWAY ASJASON COLLINS BECOMES THE FIRST
OPENLY GAY PROFESSIONALBASKETBALL PLAYER.
AS MICHAEL SAM PREPARES TOBECOME THE FIRST OPENLY GAY NFL
PLAYER THE EARTH CONTINUES TOSPIN ON ITS AXIS AND A PLAGUE OF
LOCUSTS HAS YET TO DESCENDUPON AMERICA.
BECAUSE OF THIS LACK OFCATASTROPHE IT'S UP TO STATES
LIKE ARIZONA TO PICK UP THESLACK.
>> ARIZONA'S LEGISLATURE PASSEDTHE BILL ON THURSDAY ALLOWING
BUSINESS OWNERS AS LONG AS THEYASSERT THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
TO DENY SERVICE TO GAY ANDLESBIAN CUSTOMERS [AUDIENCE
BOOS]>> Jon: I BELIEVE THAT IS THE
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.
[LAUGHTER]ARIZONA, I'LL SAY SOMETHING TO
YOU WITH ALL DUE RESPECT.
YOU ARE ON A LITTLE BIT OF AROLL.
YOU HAVE A LAW WHERE YOU CAN ASKHISPANICS FOR PAPERS, YOURMAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VOTELAW, YOUR LAW
ALLOWING DOCTORS TO WITHHOLDINFORMATION FROM WOMEN ABOUTTHEIR UNBORN CHILDREN AND
NOW THIS.
YOU ARE LUCKY YOU ARE WARMAND THAT YOU APPEAR TO HAVE THE
PERFECT CLIMATE FOR GOLF ANDPEOPLE WITH ASTHMA BECAUSE IF
YOU HAD YOUR ATTITUDE ANDSEATTLE'S WEATHER YOU WOULD BE
THE WORLD'S LARGEST USED CONDOMAND NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]UNFORTUNATELY, THAT
RADIOACTIVITY WOULD GIVE RISETO SPERMAXOMAN.
THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL ANDRELENTLESS SWIMMER.
HE IS NOT THAT DANGEROUS AMONSTER BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY A
VERY, VERY SMALL CHANCE HE'LLEVEN FIND A VICTIM AND EVEN IFHE FINDS A
VICTIM THE FACT THAT HE COULD --AND YOU CAN EASILY DESTROY HIM
WITH HIS ARCH ENEMY AN OLD SOCKYOU NO LONGER WEAR.
SO DON'T -- HAVE I SHARED TOOMUCH?
[LAUGHTER]SO PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW
THIS DISCRIMINATORY LAW IS NOTDISCRIMINATORY.
>> I WANT TO BE CLEAR. IT WOULDIN NO WAY ALLOW ANYONE TODENY SOMEONE SERVICE.
IT WON'T FORCE ARTISTSREGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU ARE TOCREATE OR PROMOTE A MESSAGE, TOFORCE
THEM TO BE IN A PARADE OR BE INAN EVENT OR ENDORSE THAT WITHTHE BUSINESS.
>> Jon: YES EVENT PLANNERSSHOULD NEVER HAVE TO WORK WITH
COUPLES THEY DISAPPROVE OF.
>> I PAID YOU GUYS FOR ASERVICE.
I WAS PROMISED -- PROMISED --THAT IT WOULD BE READY.
>> I DON'T WANT YOUR STUPID ASSWATER. I DON'T WANT YOUR [BLEEP]WATER.
>> IT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR! IWANT MY CAKE!
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: EVENT PLANNERS SHOULD
NEVER HAVE TO BE FORCED TOWORK WITH PEOPLE THEY HATE
EXCEPT 40% TO 50% OF THE TIME.
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE SAY WON'TPHOTOGRAPH A GAY WEDDING
DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE ANTI-GAY.
>> LANE IS A WONDERFUL YOUNGCHRISTIAN PHOTOGRAPHER. SHE'SMORE THAN WILLING TO TAKEPICTURES OF HOMOSEXUALS.
>> Jon: THAT MAY BE THE WORST
