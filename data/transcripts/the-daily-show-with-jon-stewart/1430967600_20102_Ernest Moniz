>> Jon: WELCOME BACK,MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE
UNITED STATES SECRETARY OFENERGY PLEASE WELCOME TO THE
PROGRAM SECRETARY ERNESTMONIZ, SIR.
(APPLAUSE)WHAT'S HAPPENING?
THIS IS-- THESE ARE HEADYTIMES FOR THE SECRETARY OF
ENERGY.
YOU ARE IN MANY WAYS ONE OFTHE KEY RESPONSIBLE PARTS TO
THIS IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, YES?
>> YES.
>> Jon: YOU WERE IN THE ROOMWITH THE IRANIANS WITH
SECRETARY KERRY NEGOTIATINGTHIS DEAL.
>> UH-HUH.
TRYING TO GET ALL THETECHNICAL STUFF RIGHT.
>> Jon: WE WERE TRYING TOGET IT-- WHAT WAS THAT WORD
YOU USED?
>> GET IT RIGHT, GET ITRIGHT.
>> Jon: GET IT RIGHT.
>> Jon: FASCINATING!>> RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YOU UNDERSTAND THENUCLEAR ISSUES.
THERE ARE APPARENTLY FOURPATHWAYS, THEY CONSIDER THEM
FOUR PATHWAYS TOGETTING A BOMB.
THIS STRUCTURE OF THE DEALIS TO PREVENT THEM FROM
DOING SO.
ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THEPARAMETERS OF THIS DEAL?
>> YES, I AM.
NO PLUTONIUM, NO URANIUM ANDNO COVERT ACTIVITY.
>> Jon: NO COVERT ACTIVITY.
>> THAT'S THE IDEA.
OR DETECT IT, THAT IS, I MEAN,YOU KNOW. RIGHT.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, I'MPRETTY SURE THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF
COVERT ACTIVITY IS THAT YOUDON'T KNOW ABOUT IT.
>> WELL, THAT IS THE GOAL.
BUT WE HAVE A PRETTYGOOD PROCESS IN PLACE.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THE GREATESTCHALLENGE BEYOND OUR OWN
CONGRESS OF THIS DEAL?
(APPLAUSE)>> THE-- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
SERIOUSLY, WE NEED TO HAVE AGOOD DEAL IN THE
SENSE THAT IT IS VERIFIABLE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT IS ALL BASED UPONVERIFICATION.
AND WE START OUT WITH VERY, VERYSTRONG CONSTRAINTS ON THE
PROGRAM.
>> Jon: WELL, THEY HAVEABOUT 19,000 CENTRIFUGES?
>> 19,000 NOW. THAT'S RIGHT.
AND 10,000 KILOGRAMS OFENRICHED URANIUM,
WE'RE GOING TO TAKEIT DOWN TO 300. SO --
>> Jon: HOW MUCH ENRICHEDURANIUM DO YOU NEED AND HOW
MANY CENTRIFUGES DO YOU NEEDTO GET BOMB READY?
>> LET'S SAY RIGHT NOW THEY'REIN THE RANGE OF IF THAT MATERIAL
WERE CONVERTED TO BOMBS ITWOULD BE EIGHT TO TEN.
SO IT'S QUITE --
>> Jon: EIGHT TO TEN BOMBS.
>> EIGHT TO TEN.
>> Jon: HOW LONG WOULD ITTAKE THEM TO GET TO EIGHT TO
TEN BOMBS?
>> THAT'S -- THERE ARE TWODIFFERENT ISSUES.
ONE IS GETTING THE MATERIALENRICHED PROPERLY.
RIGHT NOW THAT IS PROBABLY ACOUPLE MONTHS.
WE WOULD WITH THIS AGREEMENT,ASSUMING WE REACH IT, ARE
GOING TO BE OVER A YEAR.
SO IT GIVES US A LOT MORETIME TO REACT.
THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES TOGET TO A BOMB BESIDES THE
MATERIAL, BUT WE'RE JUSTFOCUSING ON THAT.
>> Jon: WHAT IS THEOTHER-- ONCE YOU GET ALL THE
MATERIALS, IS IT A TYPE OFRECIPE LIKE OH, I'M SUPPOSED
TO FOLD IN THE URANIUM, NOTPUT IT IF BEFORE I PUT
IT-- LIKE IS THAT?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW -- WELL, YOUGO ON THE INTERNET, YOU KNOW,
AND YOU FIND OUT-- .
>> Jon: DO THEY FIND THATSORT OF THING OUT THERE?
>> OH YEAH, FOR SURE.
>> Jon: DO WE THINK, I MEAN, ASTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES, THIS IS
GOING TO BECOME MORE AND MORE OFA FOOL'S ERRAND, NO?
WON'T THE TECHNOLOGY TOCREATE A TYPE OF NUCLEAR
WEAPON BECOME MORE AVAILABLETO MORE COUNTRIES AND A
PROLIFERATION REGIMEBE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT?
>> THAT'S WHY, ACTUALLY, THEMAIN FOCUS IS ALWAYS ON THE
NUCLEAR MATERIAL.
THAT IS THE LONG POLE IN THETENT, BASICALLY.
SO WE'VE GOT TO TRACK THEMATERIAL, WE HAVE A
UNPRECEDENTSED MEANS IN THISAGREEMENT, ASSUMING AGAIN
THAT WE  FINISH IT, TOACTUALLY TRACK THE
URANIUM ALL THE WAY BACK TOTHE MINES, ALL THE WAY
THROUGH ENRICHMENTPROCESS.
>> Jon: WHERE DOES THEMATERIAL USUALLY COME FROM?
>> URANIUM?
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> COMES FROM THE GROUND FROM AMINE.
>> Jon: NO, NO, I DON'T MEAN --I MEANT LIKE --
(LAUGHTER)>> YOU KNOW.
>> Jon: I MEAN WHAT COUNTRYWOULD BE THE SOURCE OF IT?
UNLESS THEY HAVE THEIR OWNURANIUM.
>> NO, THEY HAVE THEIR OWN.
>> Jon: OH, THEY HAVE THEIROWN!
>> THEY HAVE THEIR OWN.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT -- WHY ISEVERYBODY GOING TO NIGER TO BUY
YELLOWCAKE?
>> YOU CAN ALSO IMPORT IT.
BUT WE HAVE TO-- WE HAVE TOACTUALLY TRACK BOTH THEIR
OWN MINES AND WE HAVE TOTRACK ALL THE PROCUREMENTS
OF RELEVANCE TO THE NUCLEAR --
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU TRACKTHAT?
WHAT DO YOU USE THERE? WHAT DOYOU GOT ONE OF THEM GIEGER,
GEIGER COUNTERS? WHAT DO YOUGOT THAT LIKE --
YOU WALK AROUND LIKE A GUY ONTHE BEACH JUST DOING THIS.
HOW DO YOU TRACK THAT?
>> WE HAVE NATIONAL MEANS,WE CALL THEM.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: WELL, THAT'S ALL THE
TIME WE HAVE FOR TODAY'S SHOW.
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING,DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, YOU
KNOW, BECAUSE THERE ARE ALOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE
COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS DEAL.THERE'S A GENTLEMAN IN THE
SENATE, FELLOW NAMED TOMCOTTON WHO WROTE A
LETTER TO THE IRANIANS TOTHE AYATOLLAH, I BELIEVE,
SAYING DON'T NEGOTIATE THISDEAL BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO
RUIN IT.
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED ANDYOU ARE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS, DID
YOUR COUNTERPART COME INTHAT MORNING AND GO, WHO THE
HELL IS THIS GUY?
>> WELL, IT OBVIOUSLY WASNOTICED, TO PUT IT MILDLY.
HOWEVER, THE IRANIANS AND WEHAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR.
THIS IS A GOVERNMENT TOGOVERNMENT NEGOTIATION THAT
IS HOW AGREEMENTS AREREACHED.
AND WE NEED TO HAVE A GOODDEAL.
>> Jon: WHEN YOU SITDOWN WITH YOUR RUSSIAN
COUNTERPART, DO YOU TRUSTTHEM IN THEIR-- YOU KNOW,
TALK ABOUT A LAND OF ATREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
FISSILE MATERIAL.
DO THEY HAVE, DO YOU TALK TOTHEM ABOUT TRACKING THEIR
MATERIALS?
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, WE DID ALOT OF THAT BACK IN THE 1990s
AFTER THE SOVIET UNION AND THENRUSSIA'S ECONOMY COLLAPSED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IN FACT, IN MY FIRST GOAROUND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF
ENERGY I SPENT MOST OF MY TIME,IN FACT, WORKING ON --
>> Jon: TRACKING --
>> SECURING RUSSIAN MATERIALSAND TRACKING IT.
>> Jon: SO IN YOUR MIND IRANWILL STAY TO THE LETTER OF
THE DEAL AND MAKE ITVERIFIABLE.
AND IF THEY DON'T, THEN WEWILL BE,
WE'LL PROBABLY REALLY MAD.
>> WE RETAIN ALL OF OUROPTIONS WITH THE DEAL.
OBVIOUSLY WE HOPE THAT THEYWILL OBSERVE IT.
BUT AGAIN, THIS IS NOT BUILTUPON TRUST.
IT'S BUILT UPON SOME PRETTYHARD-NOSED SET OF PROCESSES,
OBSERVATIONS, VERIFICATIONS -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> ACCESS, TRANSPARENCY AND
THAT IS THE NATURE OF THE DEAL.
>> Jon: AND YOU TRUST THEM.
>> WE WILL VERIFY.
>> Jon: AND THEY TRUST YOU.
>> WE WILL VERIFY.
THEY WILL-- .
>> Jon: STICK AROUND, I WANTTO TALK ABOUT ENERGY WHEN WE
COME BACK.>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Jon: SECRETARY ERNEST MONIZ,
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
