[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: THE BIG STORY THIS
MIDTERM ELECTION SEEMS TO BEREPUBLICANS WINNING SEATS
CURRENTLY HELD BY DEMOCRATS. BUTTHERE ARE A FEW REPUBLICAN
AREAS WHERE DEMOCRATS'CHANCES LOOK GOOD. FOR INSTANCE,
NEW YORK'S 11th CONGRESSIONALDISTRICT OR STATEN ISLAND
IF YOU'RE NASTY. WHY IS IT UPFOR GRABS? DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE
DOMENIC RECCHIA'S CAMPAIGN ADSUMS IT UP PRETTY WELL.
>> COUNT ONE, LYING UNDER OATH.
>> COUNT TWO, FAILING TO REPORTOVER $1 MILLION IN INCOME.
>> COUNT FOUR.
>> COUNT FIVE.
>> COUNT 20.
Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. THE REASONDEMOCRATS HAVE A CHANCE THERE IS
THE 20 FEDERAL CRIMES THATREPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN
MICHAEL GRIMMM IS CHARGED WITH.
IT'S A BIT OF A HANDICAP FORHIM.
AS IS THIS LITTLE INCIDENT FROMJANUARY WHEN A NEW YORK 1
REPORTER HAD THE NERVE TO ASKGRIMM ABOUT THOSE ALLEGATIONS.
>> LET ME BE CLEAR TO YOU. YOUEVER DO THAT TO ME AGAIN,
I'LL THROW YOU OFF THIS [BLEEP]BALCONY.
I'LL BREAK YOU IN HALF -- LIKE ABOY.
[BEEP]>> Jon: TO BE CLEAR THAT'S HOW
HE BEHAVES WHEN HE KNOWS THEREIS A CAMERA ROLLING.
AS IF THE SEAT WASN'T ALREADYRECCHIA'S FOR THE ASKING HE ALSO
MASSIVELY OUT FUNDRAISED GRIMMOVER THE SUMMER.
SO IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT IN THEMOST RECENT POLLING RECCHIA WAS
LOSING TO THE 20 COUNTINDICTMENT BOY-BREAKING GRIMM
BY FOUR POINTS. WHICH BRINGSUS TO OUR NEW SEGMENT --
WAIT? HOW THE [BLEEP] DOES THATHAPPEN?
ONE CLUE CAME WHEN RECCHIA WASOUT GETTING THE SCHUMER
ENDORSEMENT AND WAS ASKED ABOUTHIS FOREIGN POLICY CREDENTIALS.
KEEP YOUR EYE ON OL' CHUCKSCHUMER AND WATCH FOR THE
MOMENT WHEN SCHUMER STARTS TOENDORSE THE TOPS OF HIS SHOES.
>> WHEN I WAS ON THE LOCALSCHOOL BOARD I RAN A STUDENT
EXCHANGE PROGRAM WITH JAPAN FORSTUDENTS OF HIS DISTRICT THAT HE
REPRESENTS.
ALRIGHT WITH JAPAN.
I HAVE BEEN TO ISRAEL,I'VE BEEN TO ITALY.
I HAVE BEEN TO MANY, MANYCOUNTRIES ACROSS THIS WORLD.
>> Jon: FOREIGN POLICY.
WHAT? I MET A JAPANESE EXCHANGESTUDENT.
IT'S ALL GOOD.
YOU SEE SCHUMER DO THIS -- OHBOY.
IT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN WHENEVEN CHUCK SCHUMER DOES NOT WANT
TO BE ON CAMERA WITHYOU. CHUCK SCHUMER.
THAT'S A MAN WHO SEEKS OUTLITTLE RED RECORDING LIGHTS LIKE
A SUN FLOWER GROWINGTOWARDS THE SUN.
[LAUGHING]AM I ON TELEVISION?
BUT THIS IS A HIGH PROFILE RACE.
SURELY THE PARTY HAS BRIEFEDRECCHIA ON THE ISSUES?
>> THE DEMOCRAT DEFINED HISPOSITION ON A MASSIVE TRADE
AGREEMENT PROPOSAL
KNOWN AS TRANS PACIFICPARTNERSHIP OR TPP.
BUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THEAGREEMENT SEEMED A BIT UNCLEAR.
>> WHAT EXACTLY IS THE TPP.
>> SORRY, WE'RE GOING TO HEADBACK INSIDE.
>> OKAY.
>> WHAT EXACTLY IS THE TPP?[LAUGHING]
>> Jon: TO HIS CREDIT ATNO POINT DID RECCHIA THREATEN
TO THROW THAT NEW YORK 1REPORTER OFF A BALCONY.
HE DID WHAT ANY GENTLEMAN DOESWHEN FACED WITH A GOTCHA
QUESTION LIKE, "DO YOU HAVE ANYIDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?"
HE SNUCK OFF TO GOOGLE IT.
>> A HALF HOUR LATER WE GAVE THECANDIDATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
ANSWER OUR QUESTION.
>> THE TRANS PACIFICPARTNERSHIP IS MANUFACTURING --
MANUFACTURE MORE HERE INAMERICA,
KEEP THE JOBS IN AMERICA.
MADE IN AMERICA IS BETTERFOR THIS COUNTRY.
>> Jon: HERE IS HOW BAD THATANSWER WAS.
THE RESTAURANT RATING IN THEWINDOW BEHIND HIM
ACTUALLY CHANGED GRADES.
F PLUS. THAT'S WORSE THAN AN F.
IT MEANS THEY FEEL SORRY FORYOU.
WELL IT'S TOO BAD A CERTAIN NEWYORK 1 REPORTER KEEPS SABOTAGING
THIS CAMPAIGN.
>> WHEN WE ASKED RECCHIA TOCOMMENT ON GRIMM'S RECORD ON
TRADE, HE OFFERED THIS.
>> HE HAS NOT DONE A LOT FORLABOR.
HE HAS A 44 PERCENTAGE RECORD ONLABOR. OKAY?
HE HAS A 44 PERCENTAGE RECORD ONLABOR.
MY RECORD IS MUCH BETTER THANTHAT.
>> A 44 PERCENTAGE RECORD FROMWHERE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> WHEN YOU RATE IN LABOR HE HASA 44 PERCENTAGE RECORD ON LABOR.
>> Jon: WHAT, NO? WHAT ARE YOUTALKING ABOUT?
LABOR, THE LABOR PLACE WITH THEPERCENTS THAT THEY RATE YOU.
[LAUGHING]NOW, NOW,
IF YOU DON'T MIND I HAVE TO GOBACK INSIDE THE BRICK THINGY
WITH THE ROOF.
[LAUGHING]
SO THE DEMOCRATS ARE BLOWINGTHIS. BUT THERE IS STILL THE
LITTLE MATTER OF GRIMM'S FEDERALCRIMINAL CHARGES.
AND THAT CAME UP AT THEIRDEBATE.
AND I BET GRIMM'S NOT GOING TOHAVE A VERY GOOD ANSWER FOR IT.
>> EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIRDAY IN COURT.
AND AS A UNITED STATES MARINE,[ APPLAUSE ]
I FOUGHT FOR THT CONSITUTIONALRIGHT.
SO I'LL HAVE MY DAY INCOURT.
>> Jon: THEY [BEEP] APPLAUD, THEGUY IS UP ON 20 CHARGES.
WHERE ARE THEY HOLDING THISDEBATE THE HOME FOR RETIRED
WASTE MANAGEMENT SUPERVISORS ANDLEGITIMATE BUSINESSMEN.
YA, YA, YOU GET YOUR DAY INCOURT.
YOU SHOW THESE [BLEEP], MIKEY.
MAYBE THE PROSECUTOR WON'T SHOWUP, HE'S SUCH A GABA GOO --
[LAUGHING]EITHER WAY I THINK WE
CAN AGREE THE REAL WINNER HEREIS NEW YORK'S 11th BECAUSE
WHATEVER HAPPENS BETWEEN NOW ANDNOVEMBER ONE OF THESE TWO
GENTLEMEN IS GOING TO BEREPRESENTING YOU IN CONGRESS.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
