(LAUGHTER)YOU HAVE MADE A TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE MISTAKE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> SEE THAT'S THE VIEW OFTHE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE
BUBBLEVILLE THAT I TALKABOUT IN THIS BOOK.
>> Jon: WHAT DO YOU MEAN,AMERICA?
>> NO.
NOW, THE WHOLE POINT IS THATTHERE IS A REAL CLASH OF
CULTURES AND THERE IS ADISCONNECT BETWEEN PEOPLE
WHO LIVE IN THE BUBBLES -->> Jon: YEAH.
>> OF NEW YORK, WASHINGTON AND
HOLLYWOOD VERSUS THE PEOPLEWHO LIVE IN THE LAND OF THE
BUBBAS.
>> Jon:  IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE ISAN IDEA,
THERE IS A SENSE OF LIKE, WELL,PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THE COAST
ARE NOT REAL, THAT YOU ARETALKING ABOUT LIKE THE BUBBAS
ARE REAL AND WE'RE NOT.
>> NO, IT'S NOT, IT'S NOT AMATTER OF REALITY.
IT'S A MATTER OF DIFFERENTPERSPECTIVE.
I WILL GIVE AN EXAMPLE.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCEBETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL
EDUCATED AND PEOPLE WHO ARESMART.
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERYWELL EDUCATED, LET'S SAY THE
HARVARD FACULTY -->> Jon: YEAH.
>> BELIEVE THAT THEPEOPLE WHO LIVE OUT IN THIS
PART OF THE WORLD WHERE ILIVE IN FLY-OVER COUNTRY,
THOSE RED STATES THAT PEOPLETHINK THOSE PEOPLE ARE NUTS.
>> Jon: RIGHT. BUT YOU BELIEVETHAT THE BUBBAS ARE BETTER THAN
THE BUBBLES.
>> NO, DIFFERENT.
>> Jon: NO, BETTER.
>> I WANT TO EXPLAIN WHO WE ARETO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN
THE BUBBLES.
BECAUSE THOSE OF US WITHOUTLIVE IN BUBBAVILLE WE GET THE
PEOPLE IN THEBUBBLES BECAUSE ALL THE
TELEVISION SHOWS AND MOVIESARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE
BUBBLES.
>> Jon: YOU DON'T. NO, YOU DON'TGET US.
>> SIX AND A HALF YEARS -->> Jon: YOU DON'T GET US.
>> I HAVE COME TO NEW YORK AND I
HAVE SEEN THE DIFFERENCE INTHE ATTITUDES AND LIFESTYLES
AND CULTURE.
IT'S NOT THAT ONE IS BETTER.
>> Jon: YES, IT IS.
(LAUGHTER)>> WELL, IF IT IS-- .
>> Jon: YOU BELIEVE ONE ISBETTER.
>> IT WOULD BEBUBBAVILLE.
>> Jon: HERE'S, HERE'S WHAT IBELIEVE --
>> LET ME TAKE THAT POINT ABOUTTHE -
>> Jon: BUT THIS FEELSLIKE IT'S A CONTRIVED -- THERE
IS NO REAL BUBBLEVILLE ANDBUBBAVILLE.
YOU HAVE THIS IDEA OF THEHOLLYWOOD CULTURE.
AND THE EXAMPLE, YOU SORT OFUSE JAY Z AND BEYONCE AS AN
EXAMPLE OF THAT, RIGHT.
YOU VIEW THAT AS A SORTOF A PERMISSIVENESS, THAT
YOU THINK IS NOT GREAT FOROUR CHILDREN; IS THAT,
IS THAT CORRECT?
>> WELL, IT WAS ONE PAGE OUTOF A 240 PAGE BOOK.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
BUT IT IS REPRESENTATIVE OFTHAT IDEA OF A CULTURE WAR.
>> IT IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF ACHAPTER CALLED
THE CULTURE OF CRUDE.>> Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> AND HERE'S THE POINT THAT IWAS MAKING WITH THE WHOLE.
BEYONCE IS SUCH AMEGATALENT.
>> Jon: YES.
>> SHE CAN DO ANYTHING.
>> Jon: RIGHT. EXACTLY.
>> I MEAN SHE REALLY, SHE'SGOT THE PIPES TO SING.
>> Jon: RIGHT. EXACTLY.
>> SHE'S GOT THE MOVES TO DANCE.
SHE DOES NOT HAVE TO GO-- .
>> Jon: SHE DOESN'T NEED TO.
>> SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO BEVULGAR IN ORDER TO SET A
TREND.
>> Jon: EXACTLY. EXACTLY.
>> THAT'S THE POINT.
>> Jon: YOU SEE THAT ASINDICATIVE OF THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BUBBAVILLE ANDBUBBLEVILLE, BECAUSE WE ARE
MORE PERMISSIVE IN THAT WAY,RIGHT?
>> NOT NECESSARILY.
IT'S THAT THE THING THATDISTURBS ME, LET'S SAY
ABOUT WHEN YOU SEE BEYONCEWHO IS A ROLE MODEL TO YOUNG
GIRLS.>> Jon: RIGHT. SURE.
>> YOUNG GIRLS WANT TO BE LIKEHER.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> DO YOU KNOW ANY PARENTWHO HAS A DAUGHTER THAT SAYS
HONEY, IF YOU MAKE REALLY GOODGRADE, SOME DAY WHEN YOU ARE
12 OR 13 WE WILL GET YOUYOUR OWN STRIPPER POLE.
I MEAN, COME ON, JON, WE DON'TDO THAT IN OUR CULTURE.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT ISDIMINISHING BEYONCE IN A WAY
THAT IS TRULY OUTRAGEOUS.>> I'M, I'M NOT SAYING THAT --
>> Jon: BUT, BUT I WILL SAYTHIS.
BUT NOW, HERE IS WHAT I WILLSHOW YOU SOMETHING.
>> OKAY.
>> Jon: HERE IS THE BLIND SPOTOF BUBBAVILLE.
>> ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
>> Jon: ALL THIS STUFF ABOUTTHE CULTURE AN IT'S SO
INSIDIOUS, AND JUST, YOU DON'THAVE TO DO THAT.
THIS IS A CLIP FROM A VERYWHOLESOME SHOW ON FOX NEWS.
>> I KNOW WHERE YOU AREGOING WITH THIS.
>> Jon: I HOPE YOU DO.
>> YEAH, I DO.
>> Jon: PLAY THE CLIP.
>> OKAY.
♪ AND I MAKE THE PUSSY PURR♪ WITH THE STROKE OF MY
HAND ♪♪ THEY KNOW THEY ARE GETTING
FROM ME ♪♪ UH-HUH
♪ KNOW JUST WHERE TO GO
♪  WHEN YOU NEED SOME LOVINGMAN
♪ YOU KNOW I'M DOING IT, MIKE♪ AND I'M DOING IT ALL THE TIME
♪ I LIKE TO SCRATCH THAT FEVER
>> Jon: SO THAT IS A SONG CALLED"CAT SCRATCH FEVER."
THE BASE PLAYER THERE WAS AGENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF
MIKE HUCKABEE.
THAT IS ON A SHOW IN THEMIDDLE OF THE DAY THAT
CHILDREN CAN WATCH.
>> NO IT IS AT NIGHT.
>> Jon: THAT AIN'T -- THAT AIN'TABOUT BACTERIA.
>> IT'S NOT?
>> Jon: NO.
BUT, DO YOU SEE MY POINT?
YOU EXCUSE THAT TYPE OFCRUDENESS BECAUSE YOU AGREE
WITH HIS STANCE ON FIREARMS.>> OH --
>> Jon: YOU DON'T APPROVE OFBEYONCE BECAUSE SHE SEEMS ALIEN
TO YOU.
JOHNNY CASH SHOT A MAN
JUST TO WATCH HIM DIE!
>> LET ME RESPOND, HOWEVER.
>> Jon: THAT'S SOME GANGSTER[BLEEP].
>> JON,PLEASE, LET ME RESPOND.>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
>> WHEN TED NUGENT DID THATSONG, 1978, NEVER GOT
NOMINATED FOR A GRAMMY, HEDIDN'T PERFORM IT ON
NATIONAL TELEVISION.
IN FACT, YOU KNOW WHAT THESONG OF THE YEAR THAT WAS --
OR THAT YEAR WAS?
IT WAS A TIE BETWEEN"EVERGREEN" AND "YOU LIGHT UP
MY LIFE."
AND JOHN DENVER HOSTED THEGRAMMYS.
MY POINT IS, THAT SONG, THAT'SAN ADULT SONG.
GEARED FOR ADULTS. BUTTODAY WE HAVE A VERY
DIFFERENT KIND OF DEPICTIONAND THINGS THAT ARE
CONSIDERED PERFECTLY OKAYFOR KIDS.
AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
>> Jon: MY POINT IS YOUCAN'T SINGLE OUT A CORROSIVE
CULTURE AND IGNORE THE ONETHAT YOU LIVE IN BECAUSE
YOU'RE USED TO IT.AND YOU DON'T FEEL THAT --
>> THERE -- I WANT YOU TO THOUGHREAD
THE BOOK AND FIND THAT THEREIS -- .
>> Jon: OH, I READ IT.
>> DID YOU? OKAY.
>> Jon: IT AIN'T SHAKESPEARE.
>> NO, IT'S -- NO, I DID NOTWRITE THIS FOR THE HARVARD
FACULTY.>> Jon: NO, LISTEN.
>> BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE OVERTHEIR HEADS.
>> Jon: THE WAY YOU USE THE TERMHARVARD AS A DEROGATIVE --
>> YES.>> Jon: IT BLOWS MY MIND.
>> HARVARD IS A WONDERFULPLACE, HOWEVER-- .
>> Jon: NO.>> NO.
>> Jon: BUT DON'T YOU THINK AREYOU USING IT AS A DEROGATIVE?
>> NO, LOOK --
>> Jon: YOU ARE SAYING, YOUKNOW, THOSE PROFESSORS AT
HARVARD THAT ARE EXPERTS INTHEIR FIELDS, LIKE IT'S --
>> NO.
>> Jon: IT'S WEIRD.
>> I HAVE SPOKEN AT HARVARD.
THERE ARE BRIGHT KIDS THERE.>> Jon: YEAH.
>> BUT HERE'S THE POINT.>> Jon: YEAH.
SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHO HAVELIVED IN THAT WORLD BELIEVE
THAT THE EDUCATION THAT THEYHAVE IS ABSOLUTELY SO
SUPERIOR TO THE EDUCATIONTHAT SOMEBODY MAY GET OUT
THERE IN THE INTERIOR OF THECOUNTRY AT A STATE SCHOOL.
>> Jon: SURE.>> NOW LET ME JUST SAY --
>> Jon: AND DON'T YOU FEELTHAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRYBELIEVE THE EDUCATION THEY
GOT WHETHER IT BE ON A FARMOR IN A THING, IS SUPERIOR.
ISN'T THAT MY WHOLE POINT?
>> THAT'S WHY I SAID THEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN -- .
>> Jon: THAT EACH GROUP BELIEVESTHAT THEY ARE SOMEHOW
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER ANDBETTER.
>> BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE,AND THIS IS THE POINT I
MADE.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCEBETWEEN EDUCATION AND SMART.
IF YOU-- .
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN INTHE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN A
COUNTRY ROAD, WHO DO YOUWANT COMING BY, AN MBA IN A
BEAMER OR DO YOU WANT ACOUPLE OF GOOD OLD BOYS IN A
PICKUP TRUCK WITH A TOOLBOXIN THE BACK.
JUST TELL ME.
>> Jon: BOTH OF THOSESCENARIOS FEEL VERY
FRIGHTENING TO ME.
>> AND THEY PROBABLY SHOULD.
>> Jon: I WANT AAA.
"GOD, GUNS, GRITS AND GRAVY."
>> AND GRAVY. AND THE GRAVY.
>> Jon: IT'S ON BOOK SHELVESNOW. MIKE HUCKABEE.
