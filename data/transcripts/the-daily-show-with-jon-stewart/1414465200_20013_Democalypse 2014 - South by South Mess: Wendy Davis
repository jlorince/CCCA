THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> THANK YOU.
Jon: THE BOOK IS CALLED,ALTHOUGH WOULD YOU PREFER TO
STAND -- I KNOW YOULIKE TO STAND.
>> I'M FINE. I'M FINE. THANKYOU.
Jon: HOW LONG WAS YOUR -- YOUROSE TO PROMINENCE OBVIOUSLY ON
A NATIONAL LEVEL WITH AFILIBUSTER, 13 HOURS? 14 HOURS?
>> IT WAS JUST UNDER 13 HOURS.
Jon: 13 HOURS AGAINST SOMECHOICE LEGISLATION, ANTI-CHOICE
LEGISLATION WAS GOING ON IN THETEXAS STATE CONGRESS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IN OUR TEXAS SENATE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT PASSED UNFORTUNATELY IN ASPECIAL SESSION, AND
IT RESULTED IN EXACTLY WHAT WEFEARED. ALMOST ALL OF THE
WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTERS THATPROVIDED THAT CONSTITUTIONALLY
PROTECTED MEDICAL CARE CLOSED.
>> Jon: AND THERE'S NO WAY TOGAIN THAT BACK?
CAN AUSTIN DO SORT OF A PLANNEDPARENTHOOD FOOD TRUCK THING FOR
EVERYBODY? GET A TACOAND A PAP SMEAR.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN DO IT.
BUT THEY CAN DO SOMETHING.
>> WELL FORTUNATELY THE SUPREMECOURT STEPPED IN, THEY HALTED
SOME OF THOSE CLOSURES, SO WEHAVE HAD SOME REOPEN AND WE'LL
CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE FIGHT.
>> Jon: THE SUPREME COURT STEPSIN A LOT AROUND HERE.
YOU KNOW, THE VOTER I.D.LAW THAT WAS -- THEY
PASSED A VOTER I.D. LAW, THEFEDERAL COURTS I GUESS FOUND IT
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AND THESUPREME COURT SAID, WELL YEAH,
BUT THEIR SO USED TO ITNOW. AND THEY DID NOT PUT A STAY
ON THAT OR THE ELECTION. IT'SESTIMATED THAT I THINK 650,000
TO 700,000 TEXANS COULD BEDISENFRANCHISED.
>> THAT'S CORRECT. MY -- THAT'SCORRECT. MY OPPONENT,
GREG ABBOTT WHO IS THE ATTORNEYGENERAL, IS DEFENDING --
[ AUDIENCE REACTS ]>> Jon: THEY'RE THOUGHT BOOING
THEIR SAYING ABBOOOTT. ABBOOOTT.
>> HE IS DEFENDING WHAT IS OFCOURSE INTENDED TO SUPPRESS
VOTE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THE DISTRICT COURT AFTERHEARING A FULL TRIAL ON THIS
ISSUE FOUND THAT IT WASTHE MODERN DAY VERSION
OF A POLL TAX, WHICH IT IS.
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE DON'THAVE THE UNDERLYING
DOCUMENTATION TO BE ABLE TO GETTHAT PHOTO I.D. AND BE ABLE TO
VOTE.
>> Jon: WELL ISN'T THERESOMETHING -- A COLLEGE I.D. IS
NOT ACCEPTABLE, BUT AGUN PERMIT IS, YES?
>> CORRECT. WELCOME TO TEXAS.
>> Jon: OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
NOW SO, IN THAT SCENARIO FOR ME,THOUGH,
IT SURPRISED ME YOU'REHAVING A TOUGH CAMPAIGN.
RIGHT NOW YOU GUYS ARE DOWN ALITTLE BIT. IS IT,
IN THE REST OF THE STATE, SO YOUSAY THAT HERE AND IN AUSTIN AND
EVERYBODY GOES, OOH BOO, BUT INTHE REST OF THE STATE THEY GO,
YAY. FOR VOTER I.D.
HOW CONSERVATIVE A PLACE ISTEXAS AND WHAT IS THE
DEMOGRAPHIC? YOU KNOW, WE'VEHEARD A LOT ABOUT IT'S
FLIPPIN' BLUE BUT IT LOOKS LIKEIT AIN'T EVEN FLIPPIN' LIKE A
COOL AZURE. LIKE IT'S NOT EVEN--
WHAT'S GOING ON?
>> IT'S ON ITS WAY. IT REALLY ISON ITS WAY.
AND WHAT WE HAVE SUFFERED FROMHERE FOR QUITE AWHILE IS TWO
DECADES OF REPUBLICAN LEDREDISTRICTING THAT HAVE
CREATED VERY PURELY DRAWNREPUBLICAN DISTRICTS AND A FEW
VERY PURELY DRAWNDEMOCRATIC ONES.
AND SO ALL OF THE CONVERSATIONSIN ELECTIONS TAKE PLACE DURING
PRIMARIES.
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS IWAS SO COMMITTED TO THIS RACE.
MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE GOINGTO FORCE IN TO A GENERAL
ELECTION A REAL CONVERSATIONABOUT THE THINGS THAT REALLY
MATTER TO PEOPLE AND INVITETEXANS TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS
REPUBLICAN-LED LEGISLATURE TRULYIS REFLECTIVE OF THE THINGS THAT
THEY CARE ABOUT LIKE MAKING SURETHAT THEIR SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED
AFTER THEY WATCH $5.5 BILLIONBEING CUT.
>> Jon: WHAT DO THEYDO -- FIVE AND HALF BILLION.
I'LL TELL YOU,
I WAS SHOCKED WHEN THEY SAIDTHEY WERE TRYING TO CUT $5.5
BILLION FROM EDUCATION IN TEXASI HAD NO IDEA YOU SPENT ANYWHERE
NEAR THAT. [Laughter]
WILL YOU STICK AROUND FOR ALITTLE BIT?
>> ABSOLUTLEY.
>> Jon: WE'RE GOING TO THROW TO--
WE'LL THROW A LITTLE BIT MORE UPON THE WEB THERE.
"FORGETTING TO BE AFRAID," WHICHIS PROBABLY WON'T BE THE TITLE
OF MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY.[ Laughter ]
IS ON THE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
STATE SENATOR WENDY DAVIS. WE'LLBE RIGHT BACK.
