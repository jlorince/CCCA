IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'SDEMOCALPYSE 2016:
THE TRAVEL TO THE PATH TO THEROUTE TO THE ROAD TO THE WHITE
HOUSE.
THE INVISIBLE PRIMARY, OFCOURSE, IT'S A TIME KNOWN FOR
ITS INTENSE JOCKEYING,FUNDRAISING, SPEECHMAKING,
FUNDRAISING.
DID I MENTION FUNDRAISING?FUNDRAISING.
AND THE ALL IMPORTANT DEEPTHINK POLICY RESEARCH THAT
THIS COUNTRY SO DESPERATELYNEEDS THAT IS TO IMPROVE THE
FUTURE OF ITS FUNDRAISING.
IT'S REALLY ABOUT THEFUNDRAISING.
THEY NEED A LOT OF MONEY.

ASSUMING THE TYRANT OBAMADOESN'T DECLARE HIMSELF
SUN KING!

NOW, OVER ON THE DEMOCRATICSIDE, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE
HILLARY CLINTON IS IN A --(CHEERING)
SEEMS TO BE IN A TIGHT RACE WITHSENATOR NOBODY AND GOVERNOR
BUPKIS.
NOT A SINGLE DEMOCRAT WANTS TOPURSUE THE NOMINATION ON THE OFF
CHANCE HILLARY MAY THROW HER HATIN THE RING!
WHAT'S SO SCARY ABOUT THISWOMAN'S HAT?
(LAUGHTER)DANGEROUS (BLEEP) HAT.
(LAUGHTER)HERE'S HOW SCARED DEMOCRATS ARE
OF HILLARY CLINTON'S CANDIDACY.
EVEN PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TOFEEL A CHALLENGER FOR THE
NOMINATION WILL ONLY SPEAK FROMA SECRET LOCATION.
>> HI, EVERYBODY. IT'S MARKRUFFALO.
I'M ASKING THAT YOU JOIN ME ANDA LOT OF OTHER FOLKS SO FAR IN
GETTING ON BOARD WITHASKING ELIZABETH WARREN

(WHISPERING)OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS JUST BETWEEN
US AND NOT IN -- SHHHHH!
NOOOOOOO!
CLINTON.
(LAUGHTER)BUT, AS PREDICTABLE AS ONE
PARTY'S RACE IS, THE OTHERNOMINATION COULD STILL GO TO
ANYONE.
WELL, NOT ANYONE.
>> REPUBLICAN MITT ROMNEY SAYSHE WILL NOT -- REPEAT, HE WILL
NOT RUN -- MAKE A THIRD RUN FORTHE WHITE HOUSE.
>> Jon: HUH! WELL YOU KNOW WHAT,WHAT DO YOU KNOW!
IT TURNS OUT SOMETIMES UNWANTEDPEOPLE DO SELF-DEPORT.
I HAD NO IDEA THAT THAT'S -- IKNEW THAT ONE.
(LAUGHTER)YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ANYWAY, AS ONE NORTHEASTERNGOVERNOR EXITS,
THIS LEAVES AN ESTABLISHMENTCANDIDATE SIZED HOLE IN THE
REPUBLICAN RACE.
>> BIG STORY IN TODAY'S "NEWYORK TIMES" TALKING ABOUT
GOVERNOR CHRISTIE WHO HAS KINDOF AN EVERY MAN, YOU KNOW,
I LIKE CHEESE STEAK KINDOF AMBIENCE ABOUT HIM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: A LITTLE BIT OF A CHEAPSHOT THERE, DON'T YOU THINK?
I LIKE CHRISTIE.
HE LOVES FOOD.
I LOVE THAT. HEY.
HE'S GOT THAT EVERY MAN'S JE NESAIS CRUNCH.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKINGABOUT?
BY THE WAY, THAT CHEESESTEAKAMBIENCE, THAT'S NOT FROM
EATING CHEESESTEAKS.IT'S MERELY THE NEWEST IN MEN'S
FRAGRANCE, CHEESE STEAKBY CALVIN KLEIN.
IS THAT -- OH SHE'S -- ALLRIGHT.
I DIDN'T SEE THAT PICTUREBEFORE.
(LAUGHTER)WELL, I DON'T SEE HOW ANY
CANDIDATE SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATEDWITH THE POPULAR SANDWICH CAN
LOSE.
UNLESS...
>> APPARENTLY HE HAS A TASTEACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK
TIMES" FOR THE HIGH LIFE, ANDSOMETIMES HE DOESN'T PAY, OTHERS
PAY FOR HIM.
>> HE FLEW ON CASINO MAGNATESHELDON ADELSON'S PRIVATE JET,
COMPLETE WITH A PRIVATE BEDROOM.AND MOST EYE OPENING,
CHRISTIE'S STAY AT THISULTRA POSH HOTEL,
THE TAB, $30,000 PAID FOR BYTHE KING OF JORDAN.
>> Jon: NOW OKAY, OKAY, WAIT-- $30,000 HOTEL TAB SOUNDS
PRICEY, UNTIL YOU REALIZETHE MINI BAR IS STOCKED
WITH FORD FIESTAS. THAT'S RIGHT.
BILLS CAN ADD UP.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELINGAND GET TO THE ROOM AND YOU WANT
A CAR BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO GETUP AND LEAVE?
YOU PAY THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THEMINI BAR CAR.
HERE'S WHAT I DON'T GET.
HOW'S IT LEGAL FOR AN ELECTEDOFFICIAL LIKE GOVERNOR H.R.
TAKING STUFF TO BE ACCEPTINGLAVISH GIFTS FROM THE HEAD OF A
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.
>> CHRISTIE SIGNED ANEXECUTIVE ORDER IN 2010
ALLOWING NEW JERSEYGOVERNORS TO HAVE
TRAVEL AND RELATED EXPENSES PAIDBY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)>> Jon: NO! NO -- NOT EW!
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE COINCIDENCE!
HE SIGNS THIS AMAZINGSPECIFIC EXECUTIVE ORDER
ALLOWING ONE MAN, THE GOVERNOROF NEW JERSEY -- WHO HE HIMSELF,
THROUGH NO FAULT OF HIS OWN,HAPPENS TO BE!
IT ALLOWS THAT ONE PERSON TO GETLUXURY TRIPS THROUGH FOREIGN
GOVERNMENTS, THAT HE AGAIN,SURPRISINGLY IN THE DAYS AFTER,
HE BECOMES THE RECIPIENT OF.
THIS MAN IS SO LUCKY, HE SHOULDPLAY THE LOTTERY.
AFTER SIGNING AN EXECUTIVE ORDERSAYING THE GOVERNOR OF
NEW JERSEY AUTOMATICALLY WINSTHE LOTTERY.
SIR, GOVERNOR CHRISTIE, WHAT ISYOUR -- I'D LIKE TO -- THIS IS
IMPORTANT -- WHAT IS YOUREXPLANATION HERE?
>> CHRISTIE SAID IT WAS A MATTEROF OPPORTUNITY, SAYING IN PART,
QUOTE, I RELISH THESEEXPERIENCES AND EXPOSURERS,
ESPECIALLY FOR MY KIDS.
I TRY TO SQUEEZE ALL THE JUICEOUT OF THE ORANGE THAT I CAN.
>> Jon: MOST LIKELY WITH THETOP OF THE LINE JUICER HE GOT
FROM THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI. (LAUGHTER)
HEY LISTEN, YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIREHIS HONESTY.
HEY, HERE'S THE DEAL, I'M GOINGTO GET EVERY (BLEEP) THING I CAN
GET LEGALLY OUT OF THIS OFFICEINCLUDING EXTRA (BLEEP) THAT I
MYSELF MADE LEGAL, HA HA HA HAHA!
(LAUGHTER)NOW CHRISTIE'S COMFORT
WITH CORRUPTION IS PROBABLYGOING TO COME BACK AND BITE HIM,
SO THERE'S STILL A PRESIDENTIALNOMINATION OPENING AVAILABLE.
>> GETTING A LOT OF BUZZ THISWEEK, JEB BUSH.
>> IF JEB BUSH DECIDES TO RUN.
HE IMMEDIATELY BECOMES ASIGNIFICANT FRONTRUNNER.
>> HE IS GOING TO BE AFORMIDABLE CANDIDATE.
>> THERE IS SO MUCH EXCITEMENTAROUND A JEB BUSH.
>> Jon: OH WELL -- NO, WELL,NOW, IT COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE WE
HAVE HAD THE REQUISITE TWO-TERMDEMOCRATIC PRESIDENCY REFRACTORY
PERIOD BETWEEN BUSH PRESIDENCIESAS REQUIRED BY THE CONSTITUTION.
(LAUGHTER)I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION HERE
IS WILL JEB EMBRACE HIS ROOTS?
>> I'M PRETTY PROUD ALSO OF 41AND 43.
I LOVE THEM VERY MUCH.
I KNOW THAT'S HARD FOR THEPOLITICAL WORLD TO ACCEPT BUT
IT'S PRETTY EASY FOR ME TO LOVETHEM AND I LOVE THEM
UNCONDITIONALLY.
>> Jon: LOOK, NO ONE ISSUGGESTING THAT YOU STOP LOVING
YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSETHEY'RE BAD AT THEIR JOBS.
AND TO BE FAIR, YOUR DAD WASN'TEVEN THAT BAD!
YOUR DAD WAS PRETTY GOOD!
ESPECIALLY IN RETROSPECT!
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T CALL YOUR DADTHE GREATEST MAN ALIVE OR
ANYTHING, BUT, YOU KNOW!
>> MY DAD IS THE GREATEST MANALIVE AND IF ANYBODY DISAGREES
WE'LL GO OUTSIDE UNLESSYOU'RE LIKE 6'5" AND 250

BOOK "I ONLY FIGHT OLD, SMALLPEOPLE."
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
