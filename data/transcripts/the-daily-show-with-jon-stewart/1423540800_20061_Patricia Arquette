THE PARENTS.
AND IT MAKES YOU WANT TONOTE THOSE MOMENTS IN YOUR
OWN LIFE.
DOES IT CHANGE THE WAY YOULOOK AT YOUR FAMILY?
>> WELL TWO -- A COUPLE THINGSTHAT HAPPENED THAT WERE
INTERESTING.
ONE, IN PLAYING IT, THEREWOULD BE A MOMENT LIKE THERE
WAS A SCENE WITH ASTEP-FATHER CHARACTER AND THE
BOY HAS PAINTED NAILS. AND SOWE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT SCENE
BECAUSE I SAID WHY -- THE MOM ISAT THIS POINT IN HER CAREER.
THIS POINT IN HERDEVELOPMENT.
WHY IS SHE OKAY WITH THISKIND OF ARGUMENT?

ENGAGING.
AND JUST THINKING ABOUT THATIS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS
WHERE LATER WHEN HE'S ANADULT.

ALSO THE OTHER THINGS WEOMIT FROM OUR OWN MEMORY --
>> Jon: SURE.
>> AS WE GO ALONG BEINGPARENTS.
>> Jon: WHO DO YOU BELIEVE INYOUR PARENTING,
DO YOU BELIEVE YOU OR YOUR KIDS?
>> I THINK, I THINK THE TRUTHLIES SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.
I MEAN, SOMETIMES THEY WILL MAKEARGUMENTS.

AND ALL THAT, TO WHEN THEY DO.
