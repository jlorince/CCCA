ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS GET TOGETHER MAIN PLAYERS IN THIS DRAMA AS EACH OF THEM SLIPPED UP IN THE PUBLIC
REMARKS LAST WEEK.
>> I'M PRESENTING A FAIR DEAL.
THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T TAKE IT MEANS THAT I SHOULD SOMEHOW, YOU KNOW, DO IT A JEDI MIND MELD
WITH THESE FOLKS AND CONVINCE THEM TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT.
>> HOW MUCH MORE MONEY DO WE WANT TOLL STEAL FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO FUND MORE GOVERNMENT?
>> Jon: DID YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED THERE?
OBAMA'S MESSUP WAS HE CONFUSED THE STAR WEEKS JEDI MIND TRICK WITH THE STAR TREK VULCAN MIND
MELD TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.
JOHN BOEHNER REFERRED TO TAXATION AS THEFT WHICH SHOWS THAT THE LACKS UNDERSTAND OF
CONSTITUTION WHICH WAS IS HE IN CHARGE.
I WONDER WHICH GETS MORE ATTENTION.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA GETTING THE WRATH OF SCI-FI FANS.
>> SAYING THERE WAS NO JEDI MIND MELD.
>> THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO CONFUSE THE MIND MELD WITH STAR WARS JEDI MIND TRICK.
THIS IS JEDI SAJ RELIDGE.
>> DID HE MESS UP, DIDN'T HE?
>> Jon: SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE SAID TAXING PEOPLE STEALING.
IF THERE'S EVER A FACT YOU DON'T NEED TO CHECK IT'S ANYTHING TO DO WITH STAR WARS OR STAR TREK
