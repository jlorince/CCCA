[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: HOW ARE YOU?
>> GREAT, THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: THIS IS THE BOOK.
"DECODED."
THE IDEA BEING PEOPLE SEE MANY
THINGS WHEN THEY SEE YOU.
>> MULTIPLE LEVELS AND DEEP
MEANING AND OTHER MEANINGS TO
THE SONG AND EVERYTHINGED INSIDE
IT.
YOU ARE SHARP.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I DID JUST GIVE AWAY
THE END SOMETHING IN.
[LAUGHTER]
WHAT DO YOU -- SO -- DO YOU
WORRY ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF
YOU IN ANY WAY OR DO YOU THINK
THAT THEY SEE YOU IN ALL THESE
DIFFERENT WAYS?
IS THERE A WAY YOU WOULD LIKE TO
BE SEEN?
>> NO, I DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
THE BASIS OF THIS IS BOOK I CARE
ABOUT THE CULTURE AND ABOUT RAP
AND IT BEING A RESPECTABLE FORM
OF ART.
SO THE BOOK IS SURROUNDING SONGS
BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT A GENERATION
OF KIDS.
WE GREW UP AROUND THE SAME TIME
AS RAP.
RAP IS 30 SOMETHING YEARS OLD.
WE GREW UP AROUND THAT TIME.
THERE WAS WHOLE THINGS GOING ON
REAGAN OMICS AND CRACK AND OTHER
THINGS.
THERE'S A CONTEXT NWA AND
(bleep) THE POLICE WITHOUT
SEEING THE RODNEY KING BEATING
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY
ARE SAYING WHAT THEY ARE SAYING.
>> Jon: IT MAY SEEM EXTREME.
>> IT'S A BIT EXTREME.
>> Jon: EXACTLY.
LA OF LAUGH.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: DO YOU FEEL LIKE IN
TAKING THAT ANALOGY FURTHER THAT
AS RAP GROWS UP THEY GO FROM
(bleep) THE POLICE TO WHERE
THE (bleep) ARE YOU POLICE?
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
>> YEAH.
THERE'S A SONG CALLED 911 IT'S A
JOKE.
IT'S SAYINGS WHERE THE POLICE.
>> Jon: ON THE OTHER WAY OF
SAYING NOW YOU HAVE A BURGLAR
ALARM.
>> THAT WAY, YEAH.
>> Jon: YOU GO FROM A MORE
ANTIAUTHORITARIAN STANCE TO YOU
ARE THE ESTABLISHMENT TO
SERIOUSLY THOUGH WE SHOULD HAVE
YELLOW TAPE AROUND THIS --
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: IS THAT A STRANGE
POSITION TO FIND YOURSELF?
>> YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]
AH, YEAH.
EVEN OUTSIDE OF -- IT'S BIGGER
THAN ME THE INDIVIDUAL.
IT'S JUST A THING THAT SAVED MY
LIFE.
EVEN IF I'M IN A COMFORTABLE
SITUATION AND I WANT THE POLICE
AROUND, I KNOW THAT THERE'S --
THERE ARE NO POLICE IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THE REST OF
EVERYONE ELSE.
I HAVE TO SPEAK TO THOSE ISSUES
UNTIL THEY ARE CORRECTED FOR ALL
OF US.
>> Jon: DO YOU WORE DWLAI RAP
RAP -- WORRY THAT RAP -- I'VE
NEVER SEEN RAP AS A FORM THAT
WASN'T RESPECTED.
THE RAP FORM THAT IS.
EVERY ART FORM HAS THE PIE IN
THE FACE MORE LOW BROA BUT
THERE'S ALWAYS THE POET.
IT'S LIKE THE EMBODIMENT OF
RICHARD PRYOR.
HE STARTED OUT NOT TALKING ABOUT
HIS REAL LIFE.
HE GREW INTO AN ARTIST AND BEGAN
TO EXPLORE HIMSELF.
IT SEEMS LIKE THE STORY OF RAP
IS THAT SAME STORY.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THE THING ABOUT RAP IS IT'S
DISMISSIVE.
IT WAS VIEWED AS A FAD.
THEN IT BECAME A ESCAPE
ESCAPE --SCAPEGOAT FOR
EVERYTHING IN AMERICA.
GUYS THAT GOT PULLED OVER.
WHY IS THAT WEED IN YOUR CAR?
>> Jon: AS A JEW, I WANT TO
THANK YOU FOR THAT?
IF I MAY --
[LAUGHTER]
-- WHEN YOU GUYS CAME ALONG, I
HAVE TO TELL YOU, REALLY TOOK A
LITTLE HEAT OFF OUR SHOULDERS
QUITE FRANKLY.
WELL DONE.
[LAUGHTER]
IS IT, YOU KNOW, I WONDER IF THE
PERCEPTION IN THE RAP COMMUNITY
THAT THEY WERE BEING BLAMED FOR
ALL THE ILLS AND IS THAT -- WAS
IT REALLY LIKE THAT OR WAS YOUR
PERSPECTIVE SKEWED BECAUSE YOU
WEREN'T EXPECTING TO BE ATTACKED
FOR AN ART FORM WHERE YOU WERE
EXPRESSING YOURSELF.
>> YEAH, IT WAS ALMOST LIKE WE
WERE -- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
ALL RAP BECAUSE SOME OF IT IS
(bleep) AND SOME OF IS IT
GREAT.
[LAUGHTER]
GREAT RAP, YOU KNOW GREAT -- I'M
TALKING ABOUT PROVOCATIVE GREAT
RAP WAS BASED UPON REAL LIFE
SUBJECTS AND EMOTIONS AND THINGS
LIKE THAT.
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE BEING
ATTACKED FOR SAYING THINGS THAT
IS HAPPENING ANYWAY WHETHER RAP
EXISTED OR NOT THESE THINGS WERE
GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY DAILY.
>> Jon: WAS IT A VICTIM OF ITS
OWN SUCCESS?
>> NO PUN INTENDED.
>> Jon: WAS IT A VICTIM OF ITS
SUCCESS IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT
BECAUSE IT BECAME A FORCE
SOMEONE TO TO MITIGATE THE
MESSAGEth THEN IT BECAME A
THING YOU RAN ON.
WE HAD REVERENDS IN OUR
COMMUNITY DRIVING BULLDOZERS
OVER THE CDS.
TO LIKE OKAY.
>> Jon: DO THEY REALIZE THEY
HAD TO BUY THOSE TO DRIVE OVER.
DO YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTE?
>> SURE.
>> Jon: I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOME THINGS.
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COMMERCIAL
AND WE'LL TALK TO JAY-Z FOR A
LITTLE BIT.
I KNOW HE IS A BUSY MAN.
