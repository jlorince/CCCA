[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
ANOTHER BIG STORY FROM JUSTAFTER WE WENT AWAY.
WE ALL REMEMBER HOW PIPE CLEANERPARADISE HOBBY LOBBY WAS NOT
KEEN ON THE OBAMACARE PROVISIONREQUIRING FULL CONTRACEPTION
COVERAGE IN EMPLOYEE HEALTHPLANS.
WHY DO THEY CARE?
THAT GUY. LOVES CRAFTS.
HATES PREMARITAL SEX.
CASE WENT ALL THE WAY TO THESUPREME COURT AND WE FINALLY GOT
OUR ANSWER.
>> BIG A DAY AT THE SUPREMECOURT IN THIS THE LAST DAY OF
ITS TERM.
THEY RULED THAT LIKE THE REST OFUS, CORPORATIONS HAVE A RIGHT TO
EXERCISE THEIR RELIGION.
>> OBAMACARE, HOBBY LOBBYCLAIMED, RESTRICTED THEIR
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, BUT DOESA FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATION
HAVE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY? YES, THESUPREME COURT SAID TODAY
IN A 5-4 DECISION.
>> Jon: YES, A RULING CAME DOWNIN THE CASE OF HOBBY LOBBY V.
DIRTY, DIRTYCONTRACEPTION WHORES.
FINAL SCORE HOBBY LOBBY 5,WHORES 4.
SORRY, WHORES.
ASIDE FROM CODIFYING THESOMEWHAT ODD NOTION THAT
CORPORATIONS CAN HAVE DEEPLYFELT RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, ONE
THING STRUCK ME ABOUT THEDECISION.
HOBBY LOBBY DIDN'T WANT ITSEMPLOYEES INSURANCE TO COVER
CERTAIN CONTRACEPTIVE METHODSSUCH AS PLAN "B" BECAUSE
THEY SAID THAT METHODCAUSED ABORTIONS.
THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THATIS...IS...IT'S NOT...
WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR,TRUE.
AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE FOODAND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND THE
AMERICAN COLLEGE OFOBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS,
ALTHOUGH WHAT DO THEYKNOW ABOUT VAGINAS?
I DON'T THINK... NOT AS MUCH ASTHE OWNERS OF A STORE THAT SELLS
FOAM CONES AND GLITTER.
LOOK, HERE'S THEJURISPRUDENCE BEAUTY PART.
TO THE COURT, THE FACT THATHOBBY LOBBY IS OBJECTING TO
ABORTIONS THAT NEVER ACTUALLYHAPPEN DOESN'T MATTER.
BECAUSE AS JUSTICE ALITO WROTE,IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT TO SAY
THAT THE PLAINTIFF'S RELIGIOUSBELIEFS ARE MISTAKEN OR
UNREASONABLE.
FOR MORE WE GO TO JESSICAWILLIAMS AT THE SUPREME COURT.
JESSICA, THANKS FOR JOINING US.>> THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]YOU KNOW, I HAVE READ THIS CASE.
THIS SEEMS CRAZY TO ME.
>> OH, YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,RELAX, JON.
IT'S A MUCH MORE NARROW RULINGTHAN IT SEEMS.
YOU KNOW, HOBBY LOBBY WAS ONLYOBJECTING TO FOUR TYPES OF BIRTH
CONTROL, SO THIS WILL HARDLYAFFECT ANYONE.
>> Jon: WOW.
>> UNLESS, YOU KNOW,THERE'S SOME RELIGION OUT
THERE THAT'S OPPOSED TOALL CONTRACEPTION.
>> Jon: OH LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,CATHOLICISM.
>> OH, RIGHT.
I KNEW I FORGOT ONE.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> BUT STILL, YOU KNOW, THERULING ONLY APPLIES TO SMALL,
CLOSELY HELD COMPANIES.
>> Jon: YEAH, YOU KNOW, WE'VEHEARD THAT TERM "CLOSELY HELD."
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, JON, THINK OFIT AS A HUG,
>> Jon: OK, OK. >> A HUG THAT SQUEEZES
ALL THE SLUTS OFF THE HEALTHPLAN.
>> Jon: OH OKAY.
BUT THEN THIS IS, THIS DECISIONIS ONLY LIMITED TO SMALL
PRIVATE BUSINESSES.
>> YEAH, ALTHOUGH,YOU KNOW WHAT, TECHNICALLY NO
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IN THEACTUAL COURT DECISION TO STOP
LARGE PUBLIC COMPANIESFROM TRYING TO CLAIM
THE SAME EXEMPTIONS.>> Jon: ALRIGHT.
BUT JUSTICE ALITO DID SAY IT'SEASY FOR INSURERS TO PICK UP ANY
COVERAGE THAT CORPORATIONS OPTOUT OF PROVIDING.
>> Jon: BUT, I SENSE AN ALTHOUGHCOMING.
>> RIGHT. ALTHOUGH A FEW DAYSLATER IN THE WHEATON CASE, THE
COURT ALSO SAID THAT EVEN HAVINGTO DO THE OPT-OUT PAPERWORK
MIGHT VIOLATE COMPANY'SRELIGIOUS PRINCIPLES.
>> OH DEAR LORD, SO A COMPANY'SPRINCIPLES COULD BE ALMOST
ANYTHING. JEHOVAH'S WITNESSESOPPOSE BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS.
SCIENTOLOGISTS OBJECT TOANTIDEPRESSANTS.
I IMAGINE THE AMISH AREN'T TOOKEEN ON AMBULANCES.
WHERE DOES THIS... WHEREDOES THIS END?
>> I GUESS...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> I'LL TELL YOU WHERE IT ENDS.
>> Jon: WHOA.
WHOA.
>> JON, I'LL TELL YOU WHERE THISALL ENDS.
IT ENDS WITH PANTLESS MONDAYS.
>> Jon: JASON, WE HAVE TALKEDABOUT THIS.
YOU CANNOT COME TO WORKWITHOUT PANTS.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
I CAN'T, BUT MY CORPORATIONJONESY WONESY HAS A BONESY LLC
CAN DO WHATEVER THE [BLEEPED] ITWANTS.
AND AS A DEVOTELY RELIGIOUSCORPORATION, I CANNOT LET PANTS
JEOPARDIZE THE HEALTH ANDSAFETY OF THE BABY I HAVE
GROWING IN MY DICK.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: I'M SORRY.
THE WHAT NOW?
>> YOU HEARD ME, JON.
I'VE GOT A DICK BABY.
>> Jon: I DON'T. REALLY, JASON,THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS
A DICK BABY.
>> I SINCERELY BELIEVE THATTHERE IS.
>> JON, HE'S BEEN DOING THISDICK BABY THING ALL DAMN DAY.
>> DON'T BELITTLE MY FAITH,WOMAN!
>> Jon: ALRIGHT. JASON, YOURFAITH WOULDN'T BY ANY CHANCE
ALSO FORBID YOU TOFLUSH THE TOILET AFTER
YOU USE IT, WOULD YOU?
>> NO JON, THAT'S IN THEBIBLE.
LEVITICUS 721: THOU SHALT NOTTOUCH NO UNCLEAN THING.
>> Jon: WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.
>> YES, YOU WILL, JON.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA.
WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THATSOUND?
>> JON, WE TIED A BELL TO HIS
DONG SO WE KNOW WHEN HE'SCOMING.
>> Jon: I DO HAVE TO SAY,JASON, AS I... I HOPE, IT LOOKS
LIKE THE CAMERA ADDS TEN POUNDS.
[LAUGHTER]>> I DON'T... OH, NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S THE BABY WEIGHT.
>> Jon: ALRIGHT. JESSICAWILLIAMS AND JASON JONES,
EVERYBODY. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
