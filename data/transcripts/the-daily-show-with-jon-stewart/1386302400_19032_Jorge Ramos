>> Jon: HAVE YOU FELT ADIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT OUR
POLITICAL PROCESS ENGAGES YOU?
HAVE YOU SEEN OUR -- AREPEOPLE -- DO YOU FIND THEM
PATRONIZING YOU?
IN THE WAY THAT OHIO IS NOW ASWING STATE SO EVERY FOUR YEARS
THEY GO TO OHIO IN DROVES ANDRIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION IS OVER
THEY RUN AWAY AND COME BACK FOURYEARS LATER.
IS THAT THE FEAR OF WHAT COULDHAPPEN TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY
AS WELL?
>> THEY PAY MUCH MORE ATTENTIONTO US.
REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW SPEAKERBOEHNER AND MANY REPUBLICANS
THINK THEY CAN HIDE AND THEY CANDO POLITCALLY EXPEDIENT THINGS
LIKE NOT PUTTING IMMIGRATIONREFORM TO A VOTE BUT LATINOS
REMEMBER THAT.
>> Jon: IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEMWITH THEM, GET IN LINE BECAUSE
WE WERE HERE FIRST AND WE'RESTILL MAD AT HIM ABOUT A BUNCH
OF OTHER STUFF.
>> REPUBLICANS HAVE A PROBLEM.
IF THEY DON'T PASS IMMIGRATIONREFORM THEY CAN SAY ADIOS TO THE
WHITE HOUSE IN 2016.
>> Jon: DO THEY REALIZE THAT?
>> THE NEW RULE IN POLITICS IFYOU DON'T WIN AT LEAST A THIRD
OF HISPANIC VOTE YOU LOSE THEWHITE HOUSE.
GEORGE W. BUSH GOT THAT. HE WASTHE FIRST UNITED STATES
PRESIDENT WHO THOUGHT THAT HESPOKE SPANISH.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT
HELPED HIM.
HE GOT 44% OF THE HISPANIC VOTEAND THEN WENT DOWN TO 31% WITH
McCAIN AND 27% WITH ROMNEY WHOTHOUGHT THAT PROMOTING SELF
DEPORTATION WAS GOING TO GET HIMTHE HISPANIC VOTE.
IT WASN'T THAT WAY.
NOW, I ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITHDEMOCRATS IN THAT SENSE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA PROMISEDIMMIGRATION REFORM.
HE DIDN'T KEEP THAT PROMISE.
>> Jon: DIDN'T KEEP HISPROMISE, HUH?
