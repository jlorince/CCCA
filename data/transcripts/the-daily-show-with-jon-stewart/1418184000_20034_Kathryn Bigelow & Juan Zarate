(BIRD SOUNDS) PLEASE WELCOME TO THE
PROGRAM KATHRYN BIGELOW AND JUANZARATE!
HELLO!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)♪♪
HAVE A SEAT!
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING US.
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, ANDWE'LL GET TO BOY, THAT FILM HAS,
SHE SHOWED ME THAT A COUPLE OFMONTHS AGO AND THEN IT GOT US
INTERESTED IN DOINGTHIS PIECE.
IT'S PHENOMENAL AND ANINCREDIBLE STORY.
AND WE'LL GET TO THAT IN ASECOND.
THE C.I.A. REPORT DROPPED TODAY.HERE DIRECTED "ZERO DARK 30,"
AS YOU WATCH THAT YOU SEE ALLTHESE REPORTS COME OUT,
THE C.I.A. HAS BEEN LYING ABOUTTHE EFFICACY, THEY LIED ABOUT
HOW MUCH THEY TORTURED.
DOES THIS BLOW YOUR MIND?
DID YOU SEE THIS AND THINK, OH,MY GOD, WERE THEY LYING TO ME?
IS THE WHOLE NARRATIVEDIFFERENT?
>> INTERESTING QUESTION.
I MEAN, I REALLY MADE THE MOVIEBASED ON THE REPORTING THAT WE
DID AT THE TIME.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I MEAN, I APPLAUDTRANSPARENCY IN GOVERNMENT SO I
THINK IT'S GOOD THAT IT'S OUTTHERE.
BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK, IT'SCOMPLICATED.
IT'S VERY, VERY VERYCOMPLICATED.
>> Jon: YEAH, MIND BLOWING, ITELL YEAH.
IT'D BE A GOOD DVD EXTRA.
I'M NOT TRYING TO SELL EXTRACOPIES. I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF LITTLECOMMENTS IN THERE.
BUT THIS HERE, THIS, YOUKNOW, WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO MAKE
THIS FILM ABOUT THE ELEPHANTTRADE AND HOW DOES JUAN WHO
WORKS IN NATIONAL SECURITY GETINVOLVED IN THIS?
IT'S A MIND-BLOWING STORY.
>> WELL, OVER A YEAR AGO, I CAMEUPON SOME INFORMATION WHERE
ELEPHANT POACHING -- I WASALREADY IN THE ELEPHANT POACHING
SPACE ACTUALLY KIND OFINTERESTED IN MAKING A FEATURE
ABOUT IT -- BUT I REALIZED THEREWAS AN INTERSECTION BETWEEN
ELEPHANT POACHING AND TERRORISM.LIKE WHEN YOU LOOK AT WESTGATE
MALL, WHICH WAS IN THAT LITTLEPIECE THERE THAT ACTUALLY
THERE IS A CONNECTION THERE THATTHE AL-SHABAAB  WHO TOOK
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WESTGATEMALL WAS FINANCING THEIR
NEFARIOUS ACTS THROUGHELEPHANT POACHING.
I WOULD CALL IT AN ELEPHANTEMERGENCY IN THE SENSE THAT WE
HAVE ABOUT A DECADELEFT OF ELEPHANTS IN THE WILD
AT THE RATE OF SLAUGHTER THAT'SGOING ON RIGHT NOW. AND --
>> Jon: SO THIS HAS PICKEDUP? THIS IS SOMETHING --
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS BUTNOW THAT TERRORISM IS
INVOLVED, THEY'RE TAKEN IT UP ANOTCH?
>> YEAH. YEAH, IT'S ON ANINDUSTRIAL SCALE.
WHAT YOU HAVE WITH WILDLIFETRAFFICKING IS REALLY THE FOURTH
LARGEST ILLICIT FINANCINGNETWORK ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.
>> Jon: IT'S A BLACK ECONOMYNOW. DRUGS, GUNS --
>> BLACK ECONOMY. OVER $23BILLION A YEAR.
>> Jon: AND WILDLIFE.
>> RIGHT. AND IVORY HAS EXPLODEDIN TERMS OF VALUE.
CHINA IS A MAJOR DEMANDER FORTHE PRODUCTS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> CERTAINLY THE U.S. AS WELL.
AND WHAT YOU SEE AS KATHRYN HASPOINTED OUT SO VIVIDLY IN THE
FILM IS THAT THESE GROUPS,AL-SHABAAB MOVEMENT WHICH IS
CONNECTED TO AL QAEDA INSOMALIA.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THE JANJAWEED MILITIARESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF
THE ATROCITIES IN DARFUR,THEY'RE IN ON THIS AS WELL.
YOU HAVE AS WELL THE LORD'SRESISTANCE ARMY, KEEP IN MIND,
THEY'RE THE MASSIVEKIDNAPPERS OF CHILDREN
AND THEY HAVE KILLED HUNDREDSOF PEOPLE.
THEY'VE ALL TAPPED INTO THISNETWORK AND TO THIS ECONOMY AND
ARE PROFITING FROMIT. AND SO, THIS IS REALLY
WHERE OUR NATIONALSECURITY MEETS OUR NATURAL
SECURITY AND THAT'S WHY I JOINEDWITH KATHRYN TO HELP HER OUT.
>> Jon: SO THIS IS, AND YOU COMEUP WITH THIS FILM AND IT'S
BEAUTIFULLY DONE AND VERYARTISTICALLY RENDERED,
BUT THERE IS THE CONNECTIONWHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU THINK, OH, MY GOD, THATLITTLE ELEPHANT I HAVE THAT
I GOT IN THE SOUVENIR SHOP --
>> WELL, RIGHT. WELL IT'S KINDOF --
>> I MEAN, THEY SAID IT WASN'TIVORY BUT MAYBE IT IS IVORY
AND MAYBE THIS IS CONTRIBUTINGTO THIS TRADE.
>> EXACTLY. I MEAN,THIS IS THE SORT OF TERRORISM
THAT YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUTBY NOT BUYING THESE LITTLE
TRINKETS, BY NOT SUPPORTING THISTRADE. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN
ACTUALLY PUT A, YOU KNOW,STOP ON THEIR REVENUE STREAM.
>> Jon: BUT DIDN'T WE DO THAT?
IN THIS COUNTRY, WE MADE THEIVORY TRADE ILLEGAL, YES?
>> YEAH THERE WAS A PERIODBOTH IN THE U.S. AND
INTERNATIONALLY WHERE THEREWAS REALLY A BAN ON IVORY TRADE.
THAT HAS NOW INCREASED AND NOWWITH THE INCREASING WEALTH IN
ASIA, THIS DEMAND HAS PICKED UPAND THESE GROUPS ARE PROFITING.
>> AND ACTUALLY NEW YORK ISTHE SECOND BIGGEST MARKET IN
THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF ASIA.
>> I USED TO LIVE DOWN ON CANALSTREET.
AND THEY SELL THE LITTLE -- IMEAN IT'S AN IVORY ELEPHANT.
THEY ACTUALLY CARVE THE THINGTHAT THEY GOT IT FROM.
>> AND THE TRAGEDY IS THEYACTUALLY CUT THE FACE OFF
OF THE ELEPHANT SOMETIMES WHILETHEY'RE STILL ALIVE TO GET
THE TUSKS OUT.
>> Jon: IT'S HORRIBLE.>> IT'S HORRIBLE.
>> SO, WHAT CAN BE DONE NOW WHENYOU SAY WELL THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN DO. I MEAN, WE TRIEDTHAT WITH MILEAGE FOR OUR
CARS BECAUSE THEY WEREALSO USING OIL.
THAT DIDN'T WORK.
>> WELL, ONE ELEPHANT -- THAT'STRUE.
ONE ELEPHANT IS APPROXIMATELYKILLED EVERY 15 MINUTES.
MY HOPE IS WELL WE HAVE THISWEB SITE, THERE ARE A LOT OF
ACTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLETHERE.
YOU CAN WRITE INTERPOL, YOUCAN WRITE THE U.N., YOU CAN
WRITE THE WHITE HOUSE, YOUCAN WRITE CONGRESSMEN,
THEY'RE ACTUALLY A BIPARTISANCOALITION THAT IS THERE TO
SUPPORT THE ELEPHANTS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SUPPORT LEGISLATION TOPROTECT THE ELEPHANTS.
BUT MY HOPE IS WE COULD PERHAPSCREATE AN ACTIVIST EVERY
15 MINUTES.
>> Jon: WITHIN THE COUNTRIESTHAT THIS IS OCCURRING, IS THERE
A MOVEMENT TO PREVENT THIS OR ISIT BEYOND THEIR SCOPE AND
BEYOND THEIR CONTROL?
>> WELL THE PROBLEM IS THEPOACHERS, THE NETWORKS AND
TERRORISTS ARE OUTGUNNING ANDOUTSPENDING THE GOVERNMENT
AND THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THERE'S A RECOGNITION.
YOU KNOW, THE LOSS OF THEELEPHANTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT IS
REALLY A LOSS IN TOURISTREVENUE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> IT'S A LOSS IN THE ABILITY TOHAVE A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY.
SO THERE'S A RECOGNITION THATTHIS IS A PROBLEM, BUT THESE ARE
GROUPS THAT ARE VIOLENT, THEY'RETRYING TO MAKE A PROFIT AND
THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL NOT JUSTELEPHANTS BUT PEOPLE.
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'VEGOT.
>> WELL, LIKE THEWESTGATE -- WELL, EXACTLY.
>> Jon: RIGHT. EXACTLY ANDTHAT'S WHAT'S FUNDING THESE
THINGS.
>> SO YOU'RE NOT JUST SAVINGELEPHANTS. EXACTLY.
YOU'RE NOT JUST SAVING ELEPHANT,YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAVING PEOPLE.
AND WE HAVE A DECADE BEFORE THEYWILL BE EXTINCT.
>> Jon: WELL, I HAVE TO SAY,AS A METHOD FOR GETTING IT OUT,
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL WORKAND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: AND THANK YOU FORSHOWING IT TO ME AND
THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT ANDTHANKS FOR BEING AT THE
FOREFRONT OF THIS, AND YOU ASWELL.
