>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GUEST TONIGHT, EDIE FALCO.
SHE'S THE STAR OF "NURSE
JACKIE", GREAT SHOW.
BUT FIRST, THE 2012 PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN WILL MOST LIKELY BE
BEST REMEMBERED FOR THE BATTLE
THE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
WAGED FOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN
VOTE.
>> IN 2012 PRESIDENT OBAMA WON
93% OF THE BLACK VOTE.
>> Jon: OH, THEY WERE SO
CLOSE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE AS
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STARTS
MINORITY VOTER OUTREACH PROGRAM.
YESTERDAY KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND
PAUL FELL ASLEEP ON THE
WASHINGTON METRO'S GREEN LINE
AND ENDED UP AT HISTORICALLY
BLACK HOWARD UNIVERSITY WHERE HE
DECIDED TO SPEAK.
>> SOME PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME ARE
YOU NERVOUS ABOUT SPEAKING AT
HOWARD.
SOME HAVE SAID I'M EITHER BRAVE
OR CRAZY TO BE HERE TODAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: BUT THAT'S WHAT HEROS
DO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEY DON'T THINK ABOUT THE ODDS
WHEN THEY PLUNGE HEADFIRST INTO
A SYMPOSIUM WITH HIGH ACHIEVING
STUDENTS AT A PRESTIGIOUS
UNIVERSITY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT GO AHEAD YOU HAD THEM AT
"YOU'RE CRAZY."
>> HOW ABOUT THE PARTY THAT
FIRST ELECTED THE BLACK SENATOR,
THE PARTY THAT ELECTED THE FIRST
AFRICAN-AMERICAN CONGRESSMEN,
HOW DID THAT PARTY BECOME A
PARTY THAT NOW LOSES 95% OF THE
BLACK VOTE.
>> Jon: I'LL TAKE THAT ONE.
BECAUSE FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS
THEY'VE EMBRACES THE SOUTHERN
STRATEGY WHICH STATED THAT QUOTE
FROM NOW ON THE REPUBLICANS ARE
NEVER GOING TO GET MORE THAN 20%
OF THE NEGRO VOTE AND THEY DON'T
NEED ANYMORE THAN THAT.
THEY WOULD BE SHORT SIGHTED IF
THEY WEAKENED THE VOTING RIGHTS
ACT BECAUSE THE SOONER THE
NEGRO-PHONE WHITES WILL SWITCH
TO THE REPUBLICANS.
THAT'S WHY THE VOTES ARE.
ALL THE WAY UP TO THE PRESENT
DAY WHERE THE PARTY HAD A
SERIOUS PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER
THAT LIVED ON A RANCH THAT HAD
ONCE BEEN CALLED.
>> NIGGER HEAD.
>> Jon: RIGHT, THAT.
SO ALL THAT WILL TEND TO
ALIENATE A VOTING BLOCK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
-1-WHY DO YOU THINK THEY'VE BEEN
VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS?
>> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HASN'T
TALKED ENOUGH ABOUT THE GREAT
HISTORY AND INTERACTION BETWEEN
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND BLACK
HISTORY AND VOTING RIGHTS IN OUR
COUNTRY.
THE STORY OF EMANCIPATION, OF
VOTING RIGHTS AND CITIZENSHIP TO
THE MODERN ERA IS THE HISTORY OF
REPUBLICAN PARTISM WE SEE
HORRIBLE RACISM THAT HAPPENED IN
THE 30s, 40s, 50s, IT WAS
ALL DEMOCRATS.
IT WASN'T REPUBLICANS.
>> Jon: RIGHT BUT FOR THE MOST
PART THOSE BIGOTED DEMOCRATS IN
THE 30s, 40s AND 50s
BECAME REPUBLICANS POST THE
MODERN CIVIL RIGHTS EVERY ARE
BECAUSE OF IT.
YOU CAN'T JUST YADA YADA YADA
THE LAST 60 YEARS.
A REPUBLICAN FREED THE SLAVES.
GAYS, BLACK PEOPLE THE VOTE.
YADA YADA AND NOW I'LL VOTE
DEMOCRATIC.
WHAT THE HELL.
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS THEORY
THAT ALL THAT STANDS BETWEEN THE
REPUBLICANS ANT PLURALITY OF THE
BLACK SHIFT A HISTORY LESSON IS
WELL, ENJOY.
>> HOW MANY OF YOU -- IF I WOULD
HAVE SAID WHO DO YOU THINK THE
FOUND YOURS OF NAACP WOULD
EVERYBODY KNOW THE FOUNDERS WERE
REPUBLICANS.
>> YES.
>> YOU KNOW MORE THAN I KNOW.
>> AND I DON'T MEAN THAT TO BE
INSULTING I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
KNOW AND I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHAT THE CONNECTION IS.
>> Jon: CALM DOWN, EVERYBODY.
JUST CALM DOWN.
RED TEAM START THE CAR.
TURNS OUT I'M NEITHER CRAZY NOR
BRAVE.
THE GRAY HAIR NEEDS TO BE
PLUCKED.
REMOVE THE VANILLA BEAN FROM THE
HOT
