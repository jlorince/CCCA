NEXT WITH HIS GIANT DONG?
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, YOU CAN'T EXPECT ROMNEY TO
LAY OUT A SPECIFIC PLAN WITH
NUMBERS AND BUDGETS.
HE'S NOT A BUSINESSMAN, HE'S --
SORRY?
(LAUGHTER)
WE NEED A NUMBERS GUY.
>> THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW ME, I'M
KIND OF A NUMBERS GUY.
>> Jon: THERE HE IS!
THE CAPITOL HILL ACCOUNTANT!
THE WONK FROM WISCONSIN.
THE MATHEMATICIAN FROM --
MADISON'S GENERAL VICENTE FOX
CINDY.
LAY IT ON US, NUMBERS GUY.
HOW DO WE KNOW THE ROMNEY/RYAN
FISCAL PLAN WILL WORK?
>> I'VE RUN THE NUMBERS IN
CONGRESS, THEY DO.
>> Jon: OKAY.
(LAUGHTER)
SO WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS?
>> HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST?
>> IT'S REVENUE NEUTRAL.
>> HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST?
>> IT'S REVENUE NEUTRAL.
>> YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ME MATH.
>> WELL, I DON'T HAVE THE -- IT
WOULD TAKE ME TOO LONG TO GO
THROUGH ALL OF THE MATH.
>> Jon: HOW ABOUT THIS?
YOU BUSY?
LEAVE IT WITH US, WE'LL LOOK IT
OVER.
(LAUGHTER)
UNLESS IT'S ALL BULL (BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER)
THIS REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING.
REMINDS ME OF A SIMPLER TIME
WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS ALSO
EMERGING FROM A GIGANTIC
FINANCIAL CRISIS AND A BOLD
YOUNG MAN RUNNING FOR HIS SECOND
PRESIDENTIAL TERM WAS ASSERTING
THE NEED FOR WEALTHIER AMERICANS
TO SACRIFICE TO HELP PAY FOR
POPULAR SOCIAL PROGRAMS.
I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS
YESTERDAY.
>> LET ME WARN YOU AND LET ME
WARN THE NATION AGAINST THE
INVASION THAT SAYS "OF COURSE WE
BELIEVE THESE THINGS.
WE BELIEVE IN SOCIAL SECURITY.
WE BELIEVE IN WORK FOR THE
UNEMPLOYED.
WE BELIEVE IN SAVING HOMES.
CROSS OUR HEARTS AND HOPE TO
DIE.
WE BELIEVE IN ALL THESE THINGS."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> BUT WE DO NOT LIKE THE WAY
THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION IS
DOING THEM!
JUST TURN THEM OVER TO US.
(LAUGHTER)
WE WILL DO ALL OF THEM.
WE WILL DO MORE OF THEM.
WE WILL DO THEM BETTER.
AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, THE
DOING OF THEM WILL NOT COST
ANYBODY ANYTHING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: YEAH, I BET THAT GUY
LOST.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
