FIRST, FIRST, ILLEGALIMMIGRATION.
YEARS OF INCONSISTENT POLICYENFORCEMENT.
AND THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY WANTTO GET WITH US.

ALIENS WITH ONLY ONE SHOWINGANY INTEREST IN GOING HOME.
(LAUGHTER)AND, RED RUM.
DIFFERENT.
DIFFERENT FINGER, DIFFERENTFINGER.
I'LL NEVER FORGET HOW ONFEBRUARY 14th, 2013, I
LOGGED ON TO GOOGLE HANGOUTTO-- I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS.
TO FIND OUT IF OUR PRESIDENTWOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE
WITHOUT CONGRESS.
>> WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOWIS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO
NOW UNTIL THE TIMEIMMIGRATION REFORM IS PASSED
TO INSURE THAT MOREPEOPLE ARE NOT BEING
DEPORTED.
>> MY JOB IS TO EXECUTE LAWSTHAT ARE PASSED.
AND CONGRESS RIGHT NOW HASNOT CHANGED WHAT I CONSIDER
TO BE A BROKEN IMMIGRATIONSYSTEM.
I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THEUNITED STATES.
I'M NOT THE EMPEROR OF THEUNITED STATES.
>> Jon: AH!
TRUE, THAT IS TRUE!
I MEAN LET'S BE FRANK.
DO YOU REALLY THINK THE EMPEROROF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE
SPENDING TIME ON VALENTINE'SDAY ON GOOGLE HANGOUT?
I DON'T THINK SO HE'S THEEMPEROR.
WELL, GUESS WHAT, THOUGH, HEWASN'T THE EMPEROR THEN, BUT A
COUPLE OF YEARS LATER-- ISTHAT HE'S OFF TO THE RACES?
WHAT?
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THEIMPERIAL MARGARINE THE THING,
YOU KNOW, WHERE THE HATCOMES ON.
I'M REALLY [BLEEP] OLD.
(LAUGHTER)NOBODY REMEMBERS THAT.
ANYWAY, SOMEBODY IS ABOUT TOGO EMPEROR ON THAT.
>> I'M GOING TO DO WHAT ICAN DO THROUGH EXECUTIVE
ACTION.
>> Jon: HMMMM!
HMMMM!
(LAUGHTER)BASICALLY ALL IT TOOK WAS ONE
BAD MIDTERM ELECTION TO MAKEOBAMA GO FROM THIS.
>> I'M NOT THE EMPEROR OFTHE UNITED STATES.
>> Jon: TO THIS.
>> GOOD TO BE THE KING.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: SO MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS
IMMIGRATION EXECUTIVE ORDERTHING IS HAPPENING.
BY THE WAY, WHAT IS THISIMMIGRATION EXECUTIVE ORDER
THING GOING TO BE EXACTLY?
>> ALLOWING THE PARENTS OFCHILDREN WHO ARE U.S.
CITIZENS TO REMAIN IN THEU.S. AND RECEIVE WORK
PERMITS.
>> AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THATWOULD HALT DEPORTATION FOR
AN ESTIMATED 5 MILLIONPEOPLE.
>> EXPANDING THE PROTECTIONOF THOSE WHO CAME AS
CHILDREN, THE SO-CALLEDDREAMERS, AND EXTENDING IT
TO THEIR PARENTS.
>> Jon: OOH, IS THAT REALLYWHAT THE DREAMERS WANTED?
I DON'T RECALL ANY MYTEENAGE DREAMS INVOLVING MY
PARENTS STAYING. THAT'S ALL.
OH GOOD, LEGISLATION WASPASSED SO I CAN SPEND MORE
TIME WITH MOM.
(LAUGHTER)SO THAT'S OBAMA'S PLAN.
HOW IS CONGRESS TAKING IT?
I'M GOING TO GO WITHUNBRIDLED ENTHUSIASM?
>> WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT THEPRESIDENT TOOTH AND NAIL.
THIS IS THE WRONG WAY TOGOVERN.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: YOU HAD TO GO BACK
TO YOUR NOTE CARDS FOR THEWORD GOVERN?
THIS IS NOT HOW WE-- (LAUGHTER)
WHAT WERE WE ELECTED TO DOAGAIN?
WHAT WAS-- OH, YEAH, YEAH,YEAH.
GOVERN.
YOU CAN'T SPACE OUT ON YOURPRIMARY FUNCTION.
IT WITH BE LIKE THEINCREDIBLE HULK GOING-- HULK!
(LAUGHTER)SMASH.
SORRY, SORRY.
HULK SMASH, SORRY.
HULK-- HULK BLANK, HULK BLANK,HULK SORRY.
BUT ALL RIGHT, SO ANYWAY,THAT'S THE WRONG WAY TO
GOVERN.(LAUGHTER)
WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY ASREPUBLICANS WOULD LIKE TO
GOVERN?
>> SOME REPUBLICANS HAVESUGGESTED THEY MAY BLOCK
SPENDING PROPOSALS INPROTEST SPARKING FEARS OF
YET ANOTHER GOVERNMENTSHUTDOWN.
>> IMPEACHMENT WOULD BE ACONSIDERATION.
>> Jon: SEE, YOU DONE GOVERNTHROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER.
YOU GOVERN THROUGH SHUTDOWNSAND IMPEACHMENT.
BUT RIDDLE ME THIS, BATMAN,HOW DO YOU CONDUCT IMPEACHMENT
HEARINGS WHEN YOU'VE SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT.
HA, HA, HA.
NEWSPAPER SPIN, NEWSPAPERSPIN.
DU-DA-LA DU-DA-LA DU-DA-LA DA.
NO, DON'T-- LET ME EXPLAINSOMETHING.
THAT JUST WINDED ME.
BUT OF COURSE SAYING YOU WOULDSHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT
IN PROTEST DOESN'T MEAN YOUWOULD BE THE ONE SHUTTING
DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.
WATCH BOBBY JINDAL (R.)GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA MAKE
WEIRD MAGIC.
>> I DON'T THINK THEPRESIDENT SHOULD SHUT DOWN
THE GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO BREAKTHE CONSTITUTION.
THE REALITY IS THIS. I DO THINK--
>> YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULDBE SHUTTING DOWN THE
GOVERNMENT?
>> OH ABSOLUTELY.
>> SO YOU DO WANT REPUBLICANSTO FIGHT HIM ON THIS, TO THE
POINT THAT IT COULD SHUTDONE THE GOVERNMENT.
>> ABSOLUTELY, LET'S STEP BACK.I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT
SHOULD SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: YOU WOULD BESHUTTING DOWN-- IT'S LIKE
WATCHING A NON-JEDI TRY AJEDI MIND TRICK.
THESE ARE NOT THE DRAWINGSYOU ARE LOOKING FOR.
YOU MEAN THESE DRAWINGS RIGHTHERE? ABSOLUTE-- NO, NO, NO,
RIGHT, THESE DRAWINGS IN MYBACKSEAT ARE NOT THE
ONES -- I'M JUST SAYING.
BUT FOR REAL DISINGENUOUS ORLACK OF AWARENESS, YOU MUST
ONLY LOOK TO MITTENTING JAYROMNEY'S REASON AS TO WHY OBAMA
SHOULD NOT FOLLOW REAGAN ANDBUSH #1 AND NOT TAKE ACTION ON
IMMIGRATION.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS GOT TOLEARN THAT HE LOST THIS LAST
ELECTION ROUND.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SPOKELOUD AND CLEAR.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: ME THINKS THE
PRESIDENT'S NOT THE ONLY ONEWITH A HEARING AND LEARNING
PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER THEAMERICAN PEOPLE SAYING QUITE
LOUDLY AND CLEARLY A FEWYEARS BACK, IX NAY ON THE
IT-MAY AND YET HERE ARE YOUON THE ELEVISION-TAY.
TALKING IT-SHAY.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I APOLOGIZE.YOU LOOK GREAT. YOU HAVEN'T
AGED AT ALL. WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?PROBABLY NOT BEING PRESIDENT.
BUT THE THING THAT BOTHERSREPUBLICANS THE MOST -- THE
THING THAT BOTHERSREPUBLICANS THE MOST ISN'T
WHAT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ACTIONWOULD MEAN FOR IMMIGRATION
POLICY OR THE BALANCE OFPOWER IN WASHINGTON,
IT'S WHAT OBAMA IS DOING TOOUR CONSTITUTION.
>> A FLAGRANT ASSAULT ON THECONSTITUTION.
>> MEANS RIP IT UP.
MEANS NOTHINGING RIP IT UP.
>> IS IT TIME THE PRESIDENTJUST ALREADY DO THIS ALREADY,
TORCH THE CONSTITUTION?
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: LOOK WHO'S INTO A
LITTLE CONSTITUTIONTORTURE PORN.
>> OF COURSE IT'S NOTSURPRISING THAT REPUBLICANS
ARE SCREAMING ABOUT OBAMADESTROYING THE CONSTITUTION
THROUGH HIS EXECUTIVEACTION.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONIS TRASHING THE
CONSTITUTION.
>> HE SHREDDED THE CONSTITUTIONWITH THE AUTO BAILOUTS.
>> SHREDDED THE CONSTITUTION,ESPECIALLY DURING THE
HEALTH CARE DEBATE.
>> HIS NOMINATION FOR THESUPREME COURT, IGNORING THE
CONSTITUTION.
>> CASH FOR CLUNKERS, HEVIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION.
>> HE WANTS TO DESTROY THECONSTITUTION.
>> SHRED OUR CONSTITUTION.
>> JUST SHRED THECONSTITUTION.
>> Jon: MOTHER [BLEEP] HAS BEENSHREDDING THE CONSTITUTION
SINCE FEBRUARY OF 2009.
LIKE 20 DAYS INTO HISPRESIDENCY.
HE MUST BE DOING IT ARTICLEBY ARTICLE, SAW STYLE.
HOW COULD OBAMA BEDESTROYING THE CONSTITUTION
NOW IF THERE IS NOCONSTITUTION LEFT FOR HIM
TO DESTROY? HOW MANY TIMES DOESHE HAVE TO KILL THIS THING!
OR MAYBE LIKE EVERYTHINGELSE, THIS WHITE HOUSE
TOUCHES, THEY CAN'TEVEN GET THAT RIGHT.
