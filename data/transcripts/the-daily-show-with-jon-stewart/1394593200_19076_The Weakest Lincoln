HE IS OBJECTIVELY AMERICA'SGREATEST PRESIDENT.
PLEASE WELCOME ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]â™ª
>> WHAT SUP, EVERYBODY.
WE HAVE AN ESTEEMEDPANEL OF JUDGES FROM THE CITY
UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORKDISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR JIM
OAKS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]FROM UMASS AMHERST MENISHA SINHA
PROFESSOR OF AFROAMERICAN STUDIES AND WHAT IS THE
COLLEGE YOU'RE FROM?
>> COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.
>> Jon: DEWIT CLINTON PROFESSOROF HISTORY MR. ERIC FONER.
WE'RE GOING TO GET RIGHT TO OURFIRST QUESTION.
WHY DID ABRAHAM LINCOLN STARTTHE CIVIL WAR?
YES, JUDGE NAPOLITANO?
>> BECAUSE HE WANTED TO PRESERVETHE UNION.
BECAUSE HE NEEDED THE TARIFFSFROM THE SOUTHERN STATES.
BECAUSE HE RESENTED THECHALLENGE TO HIS AUTHORITY.
>> Jon: ABRAHAM LINCOLN, YES.
>> THEY SHOT FIRST AND YOU DON'TMESS WITH LINCOLN.
ALL THE VAMPIRES KNOW WHAT I'MTALKING ABOUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: PANEL?
PROFESSOR OAKS ARE WHY DIDLINCOLN START THE CIVIL WAR?
>> BECAUSE THEY SHOT FIRST ANDYOU DON'T MESS WITH LINCOLN.
HERE WE GO.
WE TOUCHED ON THIS EARLIER, TOO.
INTERESTING QUESTION.
IF LINCOLN WANTED TO PURCHASEAND FREE EVERY SLAVE IN THE
UNITED STATES, HOW MUCH WOULDTHAT HAVE COST?
HOW MUCH?
MR. PRESIDENT LET'S GO WITHLINCOLN.
HOW MUCH WOULD IT HAVE COST?
LINCOLN KNOWS HOW MUCH IT COULDCOST.
>> WELL, IT COULD HAVE COST $3BILLION AND KEEP IN MIND I ONLY
CARRY $5 BILLS.
>> Jon: NO ANSWER.
THERE WERE ABOUT FOURMILLION SLAVES?
JUDGE DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER?
THE NUMBERS ARE NOT EQUIVOCALBECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO TALK
ABOUT IT IN MODERN TERMS BUT IN1860 TERMS I'LL AGREE WITH THE
NUMBER, $3 BILLION LESS THANHALF OF WHAT IT COST TO FIGHT
THE CIVIL WAR AND REBUILD THESOUTH.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: PROFESSOR, WHAT IS THE
BILL FOR FREEING EVERYBODY?
>> THE $3 BILLION IS CORRECT.
>> THANK YOU, PROFESSOR.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> IT SHOULD BE NOTED IF YOU
WANTED TO BUY ALL THE FACTORIES,RAILROADS AND BANKS IN THE
COUNTRY AT THAT TIME IT WOULDHAVE COST YOU $2.5 BILLION.
THE SLAVES WERE BY FAR THELARGEST CONCENTRATION OF
PROPERTY IN THE COUNTRY.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TOBUY UP $3 BILLION WORTH OF
SLAVES AND MORE TO THE POINT THESOUTH WAS NOT WILLING TO SELL
THE SLAVES.
>> Jon: SO SLAVERY WASECONOMICALLY VIABLE FOR THE
SOUTH AT THAT TIME?
>> SLAVERY WAS NOT ONLYVIABLE; IT WAS GROWING.
THERE WERE MORE SLAVES IN THEUNITED STATES IN 1860 THAN THERE
EVER HAD BEEN BEFORE. THEIDEA IT WAS GOING TO DIE
OUT IS RIDICULOUS. IT WASTHRIVING AND GROWING ANDEXPANDING.
>> WOW.
>> Jon: WHEN HE SAYSRIDICULOUS WHAT HE MEANS IS GOOD
ANSWER.
[ LAUGHTER ]SEE ME AFTER CLASS.
[ LAUGHTER ]QUESTION THREE:  IF THE GOAL
WAS TO AVOIDDEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES, HOW
DOES SLAVERY STACK UP TO THECIVIL WAR?
LINCOLN!
>> 500,000 PEOPLE CARRY THE FOURSCORE AND SEVEN -- YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M NOT EXACTLY A NUMBERSPERSON.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
JUDGE?
>> SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 785,000 AND800,000 HUMAN BEINGS DIED
BECAUSE OF LINCOLN'S WAR.
THAT'S MORE AMERICANS THAN ALLWARS PUT TOGETHER.
>> Jon: AND HOW MANY SLAVES?
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TOHOW MANY SLAVES.
THAT WAS NOT IN THE ANSWERS TOTHE QUESTIONS YOU GAVE ME AHEAD
OF TIME.
>> Jon: YOU WERE SUPPOSED TOPRETEND WE WERE ALL SMART,
JUDGE.
YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO TELLTHEM WE HAD THE ANSWERS BEFORE
HAND.
[ LAUGHTER ]JUDGE!
WHAT IS THE HISTORICAL FACT?
>> NEARLY 12 MILLION AFRICANSWERE FORCIBLY REMOVED TO THE
AMERICANS IN THE AFRICAN SLAVETRADE.
BUT THE MOST CONSERVATIVEESTIMATE OF MORTALITY RATE
10-20%, 2-5 MILLIONMAY HAVE PERISHED.
>> YOU ARE TALKING DURING THECIVIL WAR OR THE SLAVE TRADE?
>> Jon: I THINK WE WERE DOINGTHE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE
CIVIL WAR VERSUSTHE SLAVE TRADE.
>> THE SLAVE TRADE ENDED IN1808 FORTY YEARS BEFORE THECIVIL WAR.
>> RIGHT BUT IT EXISTED FOR FOURCENTURIES BEFORE THAT.
>> Jon: IT ENDED OFFICIALLYTHEY STILL DID THAT.
IN FACT ENGLAND USED TO PATROLTHE SEAS AND THEY WOULD CAPTURE
200,000, 300,000 SLAVES EVERYYEAR.
PLEASE TELL ME IT'S TRUE.
>> IT IS TRUE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: EVEN THEY HAD BANNED ITPEOPLE WERE USING PEOPLE AS
PROPERTY AND ISN'T THAT WHAT THEWAR WAS ABOUT?
>> THE PRESIDENT USED -- FORGIVEME, ABE.
>> IT'S FINE.
>> THE PRESIDENT USED FEDERALMARSHALS TO CHASE DOWN SLAVES
THAT ESCAPED AND RETURNED THEMTO THE SOUTH DURING THE CIVIL
WAR.
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.
[ LAUGHTER ][CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THAT IS ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FORTHE WEAKEST LINCOLN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
