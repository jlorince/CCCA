>> Jon:  FROM THE 2016 ELECTION DESK.
WE ALWAYS HEAR FROM -- SHE INTERVIEWS UNDECIDED VOTERS.
THIS YEAR WAS NO DIFFERENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, JON.
I SAT DOWN WITH A GROUP OF UNDECIDED VOTERS JUST HOURS BEFORE THE POLLS OPENED.
LAST NIGHT, THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION WITH JUST EIGHT HOURS UNTIL THE POLLS OPENED, I SAT
DOWN WITH SOME OF THESE UNDECIDED MORONS TO HELP THEM MAKE UP THEIR MINDS.
EVERY DEBATE I HAVE TO SIT THERE AND WATCH PEOPLE LIKE YOU MIDDLE WITH THEIR [BLEEP] DIALS ON YOUR
[BLEEP] HAPPY METERS AT FOCUS GROUPS ON CNET.
I AM SICK OF IT, OBAMA OR ROMNEY.
I JUST WANT TO WEIGH UP THE ISSUES.
OBAMA OR ROMNEY.
STILL THINKING.
OBAMA OR ROMNEY.
STILL NOT SURE.
EVERY ELECTION THESE UNDECIDED VOTERS WAIT UNTIL THE VERY LAST -- WAIT A SECOND WERE THESE
THE SAME.
OH, MY, GOD.
THE SAME PEOPLE FROM BEFORE?
REALLY?
AGAIN.
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.
>> BECAUSE WE'RE THINKERS.
WE'RE THINKERS.
>> OKAY.
YOU ARE GOING TO DECIDE TONIGHT.
NOBODY'S GETTING OUT OF HERE IF THEY DON'T MAKE A DECISION.
NOBODY.
>> CAN I GO TO THE BATHROOM FIRST.
>> JAW MEAL, ARE YOU DID YOU DEAF.
CLEARLY I WASN'T GETTING THROUGH TO THEM.
CLEARLY I'M NO EXPERT SO I SAT DOWN WITH SHINA.
>>Y BEEN STUDYING CHOICE AND THE WAIVE WE MAKE CHOICES IN OUR LIFE.
>> HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO YOU'RE GOING TO BE ROOTING FOR IN THIS ELECTION?
>> I DID FEEL THAT THIS IS NOT AN EASY CHOICE.
>> OH NO, NO, NO, NO.
>> Jon:  THE CHOICE LADY.
THE CHOICE LADY COULDN'T CHOOSE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon:  WHAT DID YOU DO.
>> YOU KNOW ME, JON I'M KIND OF KNOWN AROUND THE OFFICE AS A PROBLEM SOLVER FULL OF INGENUITY
AND WHATNOT, SO I TOOK CARE OF BUSINESS.
GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T TAKE MY SHOE OFF MY FOOT AND BEAT EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF YOU TO DEATH WITH MY HIGH HEEL.
>> ELECTION ISN'T YET SO I HAVE A LITTLE TIME I THINK.
>> I'M GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL.
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO SEE YOUR GIRLFRIEND AGAIN UNTIL YOU DECIDE RIGHT NOW ROMNEY OR OBAMA.
>> THAT IS NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
>> OH, OKAY.
WHO DOES THIS WOMAN BELONG TO?
>> EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GO MAKE A PHONE CALL IMMEDIATELY.
>> GOOD LUCK, AMERICA.
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT.
>> Jon:  VERY NICE.
