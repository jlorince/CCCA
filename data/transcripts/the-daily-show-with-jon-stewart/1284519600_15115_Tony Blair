[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME PWAFPBLG MY
GUEST TONIGHT, HE WAS THE PRIME
MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
FROM 1997 TO 2007.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "A
JOURNEY:  MY POLITICAL LIFE."
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM TONY BLAIR.
EVERY NIGHT WE PLAY IT.
WELCOME!
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: CONGRATULATIONS "A
JOURNEY:  MY POLITICAL LIFE."
I IMAGINE IN ENGLAND WITH THIS
CAME OUT IT WAS WITH A LOT OF
POTTERESQUE FANFARE.
KIDS LINED UP AT BOOKSTORES
DRESSED AS THEIR FAVORITE
CHARACTER.
PEOPLE DRESSED AS GORDON BROWN.
[LAUGHTER]
HOW IS THE BOOK TOUR?
I KNOW THERE'S BEEN ROCKY
MOMENTS.
THERE'S BEEN PROTESTS AND SUCH.
>> YEAH, THERE'S BEEN A FEW EGGS
THROWN BUT THE BOOK HAS BEEN
SELLING SO IT'S GOOD.
>> Jon: WILLING TO TAKE SOME
EGGS.
>> NO THANKS.
>> Jon: WE CAN TALK, YOU KNOW,
I'VE READ THE BOOK COVER TO
COVER.
[LAUGHTER]
MEANING I'VE READ BOTH COVERS.
[LAUGHTER]
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN GO THROUGH
POINT BY POINT WHO IS RIGHT, WHO
IS WRONG, IRAQ, ALL THESE
DIFFERENT THINGS.
WHERE IS IT GOING TO GET US.
REALLY.
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A BROADER
DISCUSSION.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIMEth
OKAY.
>> Jon: EXTREMISM, ARE WE
BEING PRACTICAL?
I SEE YOU AS A PRAGMATIST.
I THINK IT'S CLEAR IN THE BOOK
YOU SAW YOURSELF AS MORE OF A
PRACTICAL ALLY TO GEORGE W.
BUSH'S MORE IDEA LOGICAL --
IDEOLOGICAL -- SORT OF
SIMPLICITY BUT THAT WOULD BE
MISCONSTRUED.
I MEAN THAT HE HAD A CLEAR CUT
VISION.
I DON'T MEAN TO USE THE WORD
VISION.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT -- AS A PRAGMATIST, IS OUR
STRATEGY TO RID THE WORLD OF
EXTREMISTS PRACTICAL?
IN A LONG-TERM -- YOU TALK ABOUT
THIS A GENERATIONAL CONFLICT.
ARE WE BEING PRACTICAL IN THAT
PURSUIT?
>> THINK WE'RE BEING REALISTIC
THAT IT EXISTS.
IT EXISTS AIDS MORE OR LESS A
GLOBAL MOVEMENT WITH A NARRATIVE
THAT IS QUITE DEEP.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HARD POWER
IT'S SOFT POWER AS WELL.
IT'S ABOUT BRINGING PEOPLE OF
DIFFERENT FAITHS TOGETHER,
RESOLVE THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE
PROCESS AS WELL AS THE HARD
BUSINESS OF FIGHTING.
WE DON'T HAVE AN OPTION BUT TO
CONFRONT THE EXTREMIST AND
DEFEAT IT.
IT WASN'T A PROVE -- PROVOCATION
>> Jon: NO, BUT THE POINT I'M
TRYING TO MAKE A VERY SMALL
GROUP OF PEOPLE CAN DO A GREAT
DEAL OF DAMAGE NOW.
THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT
WE'RE PUTTING INTO CHANGING
REGIMES IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN,
I LIVE IN NEW YORK.
WE HAVE COCKROACHES.
I'M RICH.
I HIRE PEOPLE TO COME IN.
THEY FUMIGATE.
I WILL NEVER AS LONG AS I LIVE
UNTIL NEW YORK CITY BE TOTALLY
RID OF COKE -- COCKROACHES.
I COULD SALE MY APARTMENT.
I COULD USE BUG ABOUT BOMBS AND
REDUCE THE AMOUNT PF COCKROACHES
BUT WHAT KIND OF LIFE IS THAT
FOR ME?
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M
SAY SOMETHING IN.
>> YES.
>> Jon: DO YOU SEE WHERE I'M
GOING HERE?
OUR STRATEGY SEEMS ALMOST
IDEALISTIC AND NAIVE.
>> LET ME TELL YOU HOW IT LOOKS
TO BE SPENDING TIME OUT IN THE
MIDDLE EAST MIDDLE EAST --
>> Jon: WHO HAS MORE
EXPERIENCE HERE THOUGH.
YOU CAN TRY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> YOU ARE DOING VERY WELL ON
YOUR BUT IT'S -- SPENDING TIME
AS I DO OUT THERE AND LOOKING AT
THIS, YOU SEE I DON'T THINK IT'S
JUST A QUESTION OF AFGHANISTAN
OR IRAQ.
YOU COULD SAY IRAN, COULD YOU
SAY PAKISTAN OR SOMALIA, YEMEN,
LEBANON, THE EXTREMIST IN PARTS
OF PALESTINE.
I THINK THIS IS -- WE HAVE GOT
TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT.
THIS IT'S A LONG-TERM MAJOR
STRATEGIC THREAT.
I DON'T SEE WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE
IS BUT WHEN IT FIGHTS US TO
STAND UP AND BE PREPARED TO
FIGHT BACK.
AND IN DOING SO TRYING TO UNITE
PEOPLE OF GOODWILL AND THERE ARE
MANY, MANY PEOPLE IN ISLAM WHO
DETEST THIS.
BUT COME TOGETHER AS PEOPLE IN
DEFENSE OF CIVILIZED VALUES AND
AGAINST THE EXTREMIST THAT KILLS
PEOPLE.
MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE DYING
INCIDENTALLY IN MANY OF THESE
COUNTRIES IT'S MUSLIMS KILLING
OTHER MUSLIMS.
>> Jon: NO QUESTION.
WE HAVE TO STRENGTH THE HAND OF
THOSE WHO WISH TO DEFEAT
EXTREMISM.
WHEN I SAY OUR STRATEGY IS
NAIVE.
LET'S BEGIN WITH AFGHANISTAN
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT STARTED.
WE'RE ATTACKED BY 19 SAUDIS
WHOSE SPIRITUAL LEADER IS
ENSCONCED IN AFGHANISTAN SO WE
ATTACK THERE.
YOU ARE A PROPONENT OF KEEPING
THE PRESSURE ON THERE BUT THE
IRAQ WAR PULLED RESOURCES FROM
AFGHANISTAN.
NOW WE'RE FIGHTING TWO FRONTS.
WE HAVE AFGHANISTAN.
WE HAVE IRAQ.
IRAQ WE'RE FIGHTING BECAUSE
THERE'S A MAN THAT WE DEEM A
THREAT IN THIS GLOBAL WAR.
SO IN DEFEATING HIM, WE'VE
LESSENED OUR HAND IN AFGHANISTAN
NOW WE'VE GOT --
>> THIS IS THE POINT.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST SAY
THE THREAT IS ONLY HERE AND IT'S
NOT THERE.
WE'RE ABOUT TO FACE THE SAME
CHOICE IN RELATION TO IRAN.
>> Jon: EXACTLY.
YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD.
BY GOING INTO IRAQ WE WEAKENED
OUR EFFORT IN AFGHANISTAN.
BY GOING TO IRAQ WE STRENGTHENED
IRAN.
>> I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER TO
IVAN SADDAM HUSSEIN.
WE TRIED THAT IN THE 1980'S.
WE ARMED THEM AND HELPED THEM
THEN AND THE RESULT WAS THE
IRAN, IRAQ WAR, ONE MILLION
CASUALTIES.
THE KUWAIT WAR, THE KILLING OF
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HIS OWN
PEOPLE, THE USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.
>> Jon: AND THE ANSWER TO THIS
NOW IS THEY'LL HAVE A NUCLEAR
WEAPON.
>> THEY ARE TRYING TO ACQUIRE
ONE ANYWAY.
THE ISSUE IS DO YOU TRY TO STOP
THEM OR NOT?
>> Jon: DON'T YOU FEEL AT SOME
POINT.
OH, MY GOD WE HAVE COCKROACHES
WE HAVE TO GET RATS TO EAT THEM.
NOW WE HAVE RATS.
OH, NO, WE GET BETTER GET CATS.
WE'RE OVERRUN BY CATS.
LET'S GET DOGS.
WE NEED POLAR BEARS.
WE'RE CHASING OUR TAILS
AROUND --
>> WELL --
>> Jon: THE STRATEGY IS OUR
RESOURCES ARE NOT LIMITLESS.
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO GO INTO
COUNTRIES, TOPPLE WHATEVER
REGIME WE FIND DISTASTEFUL,
OCCUPY IT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE
CAN REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE
AND REWIN THE HEARTS AND MINDS
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WITHIN THAT
THERE COULD STILL BE A POCKET OF
EXTREMISM IN THAT COUNTRY SO ALL
THAT EFFORT WOULD NOT GAIN US
THE ADVANTAGE AND THE SAFETY
THAT WE NEED AS EVIDENCED BY AT
TAKES IN ENGLAND BY HOME GROWN
EXTREMISTS?
DON'T WE NEED TO RETHINK AND BE
SMARTER ABOUT THE WAY WE'RE
HANDLING IT?
>> I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT TAKES THIS
POISON OUT OF WORLD.
IT'S NOT, I'M AFRAID, AS SIMPLE
AS THINKING THIS IS JUST
SOMETHING THAT IS 1,000 MILES
AWAY AND NOT HERE AT HOME.
A FEW YEARS AGO PROBABLY YOU
COULD HAVE CONSIDERED IT
UNLIKELY YOU WOULD HAVE HOME
GROWN AMERICAN TERRORISTS.
>> Jon: NO.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE READ OUR
BOOKS BUT -- THE TEA PARTY THING
ONCE THEY GOT RID OF YOU GUYS
THEY TURNED IT RIGHT ON US.
IT WASN'T --
>> WELL, LOOK --
>> Jon: WE'VE BEEN BOMBING
OURSELVES FOR A LONG TIME.
THAT'S MY POINT.
WE'RE OUT OF TIME.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL
BREAK ON THE SHOW.
DO YOU MIND.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND AND TALK
FOR A LITTLE BIT.
WE'LL THROW THE WHOLE THING
UP --
>> I'M DELIGHTED.
>> Jon: THERE'S THIS THING --
WE'RE GOING TO THROW IT UP ON
THE INTERWEB.
YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT THERE YOUR
iTUNES.
[LAUGHTER]
ANYWAY "A
