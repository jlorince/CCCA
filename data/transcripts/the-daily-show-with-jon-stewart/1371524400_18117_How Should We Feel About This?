( LAUGHTER )
SO LET'S JUST MOVE ON.
LET'S JUST MOVE ON BECAUSE WE
CAN.
TO A MUCH LIGHTER SUBJECT, IRAN.
( LAUGHTER )
OUR MORTAL ENEMY, IRAN, THE
GREAT THREAT THE PONTIEST BIT OF
THE AXIS OF EVIL, RULED BY A
TINY CARTOON VILLAIN WITH AN
IRON GRIP ON POWER THAT HE WILL
NEVER RELINQUISH.
>> IN IRAN VOTERS ARE GOING TO
THE POLLS TODAY TO ELECT A NEW
PRESIDENT.
>> SIX CANDIDATES ARE VYING TO
REPLACE OUTGOING PRESIDENT
MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD, WHO IS
BARRED FROM SEEK A THIRD
CONSECUTIVE TERM.
>> John: HOLD OHOLD ON.
SO THE MOST SERRIFYING SUPER
VILLAIN ON THE WORLD STAGE HAS
BEEN BROUGHT TO HIS KNEES BY
TERM LIMITS?
( LAUGHTER )
THAT MEANS HE TECHNICALLY HAD
LESS POWER THAN MICHAEL
BLOOMBERG.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
INCIDENTALLY, THAT IS A CONTRAST
THAT WOULD UPSET AHMADINEJAD FOR
SO MANY REASONS.
NOW, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE LAST
ELECTION IN 2009 IN IRAN DIDN'T
GO TOO WELL.
SO BRACE YOURSELF, EVERYONE.
>> IRAN HAS A NEW
PRESIDENT-ELECT, A MODERATE
CLERIC, NABBING MORE THAN 50% OF
THE VOTE.
>> John: WAIT, REALLY?
( LAUGHTER )
A MODERATE?
SO THE PEOPLE IN IRAN HAVE
SPOKEN, SUPREME LEADER AYATOLLAH
KHOMEINI'S DAYS ARE NUMBERS.
>> IT'S IRAN'S SUPREME COURT
LEADER WHO HAS ULTIMATE POWER
AND IT WAS HIS GUARDIAN COUNCIL
OF CLERICS WHO PREAPPROVED THE
SIX CANDIDATES.
>> John: I GET IT.
THESE DAYS ARE TECHNICALLY STILL
NUMBERED, JUST IN THE THOUSANDS.
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST BE
LIKE TO VOTE IN AN ELECTION
WHERE THE CANDIDATES ARE
PREAPPROVED BY A SMALL HANDFUL
OF RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES WITH
VASTLY INFLATED POWER.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
THAT WOULD BE SO FRUSTRATING.
IMAGINE HOW ANNOYING THAT WOULD
BE.
IT IS HARD FOR US IN AMERICA TO
KNOW HOW TO REACT TO THIS.
ON ONE HAND, THE IRANIAN PEOPLE
ONLY GOT TO CHOOSE FROM A
PREAPPROVED SELECTION OF
HARD-LINE CONSERVATIVES.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY CHOSE
THE MOST MODERATE ONE.
ON ONE HAND, THE THE IRANIAN
PEOPLE SEEM HAPPY, MARCHING AND
CHANTING IN THE STREETS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, AS FAR AS I
CAN TELL FROM WATCHING THE NEWS,
THAT IS KIND OF HOW THEY REACT
TO EVERYTHING.
( LAUGHTER )
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS--
WHENEVER THERE IS A DEMOCRATIC
ELECTION IN EYE COUNTRY WE'RE
NOT ENTIRELY ON GOOD TERMS WITH,
AMERICA GETS TO PLAY ITS
FAVORITE GAME--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND TO ANSWER THAT IMPORTANT
QUESTION, LET'S CHECK IN WITH
OUR PANEL OF EXPERTS.
>> A TURNOUT OF MORE THAN 70%
SUGGESTS MANY EVENTUALLY CAME
OUT AND VOTED FOR ROUHANI.
>> THIS IS A CANDIDATE WHO CAME
IN AND INJECTED SOME OPTIMISM
AND HOPE THAT MAYBE IRAN CAN
IMPROVE ITS RELATIONS WITH THE
WEST.
>> John: YES, OF COURSE.
IT'S A GOOD THING, DEMOCRATIC
ELECTIONS, 72% TURNOUT.
THAT'S HUGE.
BASICALLY, EVERYONE NOT UNDER
HOUSE ARREST IN IRAN VOTED.
( LAUGHTER )
SO THAT'S DEFINITELY UNQUALIFIED
GOOD NEWS.
>> THIS IS A FAKE ELECTION AND A
FAKE DEMOCRACY.
LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES.
>> John: OKAY, I TAKE THAT
BACK.
( LAUGHTER )
A FAKE ELECTION IS NO GOOD.
WE IN AMERICA HAVE NO TOLERANCE
FOR FAKE THINGS.
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHEESE,
DESIGNER HANDBAGS AND BREASTS.
OR, OR, OR THE ULTIMATE AMERICAN
ACCESSORY, DESIGNER CHEESE
BOOTS.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
THERE IS SOMETHING BOTH SEXY AND
NAUSEATING ABOUT THAT.
STILL, THERE IS ONE POSITIVE
ASPECT OF THIS ELECTION THAT WE
CAN ALL AGREE ON-- IRANIANS,
AMERICANS, EVEN ITOLANS, AND
THAT IS, THAT THIS GUY IS GONE,
THIS 56-YEAR-OLD WITH AN
IMPRESSIVE COMMITMENT TO THE
MEMBERS ONLY JACKET.
( LAUGHTER )
THIS-- THIS MAN WHO HAS A
Ph.D. IN TRAFFIC PLANNING--
THAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE.
HE IS A DOCTOR OF TRAFFIC,
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, MOST OF
THE TIME HIS ONLY SOLUTION IS TO
JUST DENY THE TRAFFIC JAM EVER
HAPPENED.
THE POINT IS--
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THE POINT IS-- THE POINT IS HE
NOW LEAVES HIS POSITION AS CHIEF
ANTAGONIST TO THE ENTIRE PLANET.
BUT HE WILL LIVED ON IN HIS
WORDS, HIS CRAZY, CRAZY CRAZY
WORDS.
>> AHMADINEJAD LAUGHED ABOUT
TOPICS LIKE THE TORTURE OF HIS
OWN PEOPLE.
>> HE FAMOUSLY DENIED THE
HOLOCAUST.
>> SUGGESTING THAT 9/11 WAS AN
AMERICAN CONSPIRACY TO SOMEHOW
HELP ISRAEL.
>> IN IRAN WE DON'T HAVE
HOMOSEXUALS LIKE IN YOUR
COUNTRY.
>> I HEARD THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN
IS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
>> NO, YOU DIDN'T.
( LAUGHTER )
>> John: I LIKE STEPHANOPOULOS
"OH, KNOW YOU DIDN'T."
OH, KNOW YOU DID NOT.
SO NOW WE OFFICIALLY RETIRE
AHMADINEJAD'S TAN MEMBERS ONLY
JACKET TO LIVE IN THE "DAILY
SHOW" RAFTERS ALONGSIDE THE
GARMENTS OF OTHER LUNATICS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
GADDAFI, MICHAEL JACKSON'S
COSTUME, AND KIM JONG IL'S
DINNER JACKET TO TAKE ITS PLACE
OF HONOR IN THE "DAILY SHOW"
HALL OF FAME.
SHINE ON, YOU CRAZY ( BLEEP ).
( LAUGHTER )
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
