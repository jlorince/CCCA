>> Jon: WELCOMEBACK TO THE SHOW.
WE ARE TALKING WITHSAMANTHA POWER.
SHE IS U.S. AMBASSADORTO THE UNITED NATIONS.
THE OTHER BIG FIGHT ONEVERYBODY'S FEAR GRAPHICS ON THE
24-HOUR NETWORKS IS WITHI.S.I.S., WHO WE HAVE MADE INTO
AN X-MEN-LIKE ORGANIZATION OFSUPERPOWERS THAT THE U.S. MUST
STAND UP TO AS AN EXISTENTIALTHREAT.
IS THAT THE GENERAL CONSENSUSOVER AT THE UNITED NATIONS?
WHAT'S THE SENSE THERE AND WHATARE THE COUNTRIES THERE DOING
ABOUT IT?
>> THERE IS OVERWHELMINGSUPPORT FOR THIS EFFORT
I THINK FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.ONE, I.S.I.S. IS TERRIFYING.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THEY'RE EXECUTING CHRISTIANS,THE YAZIDIS, SHIAS, SUNNIS --
>> Jon: RIGHT. BUT THEY'RETHUGS. THEY'RE NOT, THEY'RE
NOT, THEY DON'T HAVE POWER.
THEY DON'T EVENHAVE AN AIR FORCE.
>> CORRECT, WHICH IS HELPFUL.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THEY HAVE HEAVY WEAPONRY OF
A KIND WE HAVEN'T SEEN ATERRORIST ORGANIZATION CONTROL
BEFORE.
>> Jon: RIGHT, WELL, IT WASOURS.
>> YES. CORRECT. SOME. SOME.
BUT THEY ALSO CONTROL TERRITORYAND JUST AGAIN, IF YOU'RE IN
THEIR PATH...>> Jon: OH, IT'S TERRIBLE,
>> JUST IMAGINE.
SO AMERICANS WILL FINDTHEMSELVES IN THE PATH AND HAVE,
OF COURSE IN THE CASE OF OUR TWOJOURNALISTS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND SO THEY HAVE BEEN VERY
CLEAR THAT THEY WILL KEEP ONTHEIR MARCH IF THEY'RE NOT
STOPPED AND IT TAKES U.S.LEADERSHIP TO MOBILIZE AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TOSUPPORT THE IRAQIS TO DO THE
STOPPING.
>> Jon: WHY IS THAT? BECAUSEIF EVERYBODY AGREES THAT THIS
IS A THREAT, WHY DOES IT TAKEU.S. LEADERSHIP
AND WHY TO WE HAVE TO BEAR THEBURDEN OF THAT AND WHY IS IT
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS THISIS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT, SO
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ON IT, GO BACKTO WATCHING "THE GOOD WIFE?"
YOU KNOW, THE RHETORIC DOESN'TSEEM TO MATCH THE REALITY IN
SOME RESPECTS.
>> WELL, U.S. LEADERSHIP ISCRITICAL AND HAS PROVEN CRITICAL
IN MOBILIZING A COALITION THATIS WAY BIGGER THAN IT WAS WHEN
WE FIRST STEPPED FORWARD ANDDECLARED IT A THREAT.
WE HAVE ARAB COALITION PARTNERS,WE HAVE THE U.K., WE HAVE THE
FRENCH, WE HAVE THE DANES, WEHAVE THE BELGIANS.
WE HAVE, IT'S A GENUINECOALITION.
AND IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME TODEAL WITH THE THREAT.
IT IS NOT A CONVENTIONAL THREAT.
BUT IT IS ALSO NOT AN OPTION TOALLOW THESE GUYS TO JUST
HANG OUT AND PLOTTHEIR NEXT MOVE.
THE OTHER THING IF I MAY JUST...>> Jon: YEAH.
>> THE FOREIGN TERRORISTFIGHTING PIECE OF THIS IS THE
OTHER REASON WHY WEHAVE SO MUCH BACKING FOR
WHAT WE'RE DOING.
>> Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. THATRHETORIC IS TH IS IS AN
EXISTENTIAL THREAT, IT SEEMSLIKE WE WOULD DO MORE.
IF YOU WANT TO SAY TO ACOUNTRY OR TO THE WORLD, THIS IS
A THREAT TO THE WORLD'SEXISTENCE, BUT NOBODY'S GOING TO
PUT GROUND TROOPS IN AND WE'REJUST GOING TO LOB SOME STRATEGIC
BOMBS SEEMS LIKE A STRANGECOALITION.
>> I TAKE THE POINT. I THINKTHAT WHAT WE RECOGNIZE IS
THAT IT HAS TO BE IRAQI-LED ANDULTIMATELY IN SYRIA IT'S GOING
TO HAVE TO BE SYRIANFIGHTERS ON THE GROUND WHO
TAKE ON I.S.I.L. WE'VE HAVEINVESTED AN AWFUL
LOT THROUGH OURGROUND PRESENCE IN IRAQ OVER THE
MANY, MANY YEARS, MANY BILLIONSOF DOLLARS, SO MANY LIVES
LOST AND STILL ENDED UP WITHI.S.I.L ON THE BACK END.
SO THE INVESTMENT IS THROUGH THEIRAQIS, WITH THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY BEHIND US...
>> Jon: RIGHT. THAT'S NOT GOODMONEY AFTER BAD, THOUGH?
WHAT MAKES US THINK THAT THEINVESTMENT OF THE PAST TEN YEARS
WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN THEINVESTMENT OF THE NEXT TEN
YEARS?
>> WELL, ASKING THE QUESTION THEOTHER WAY, WHAT GIVES US
ANY CONFIDENCE THAT BY HANGINGBACK THIS THREAT WON'T
METASTASIZE ACROSS THE REGION.
>> Jon: NOT, NOT, THAT MEANINGWHY WOULDN'T WE BRING IN,
WHY CAN'T SAUDI ARABIA, WHYCAN'T THE OTHER NATIONS WITHIN
THERE WITH POWERFUL MILITARIESTAKE CARE OF THIS?
>> YEAH. WELL, I THINK WE HAVEMORE SUPPORT FOR THIS EFFORT
THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN PASTEFFORTS, SO THAT'S IMPORTANT
AND IT HAS TO BE SUSTAINED.THERE ARE VERY DELICATE, AS YOU
KNOW, SECTARIAN DYNAMICS AT WORKAND SO MAINTAINING THIS
COALITION IS AN EXTREMELYIMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT I THINK THAT WHAT ISDIFFERENT ABOUT THIS EFFORT,
IS THAT WE RECOGNIZE GOING INTHAT IT'S GOING TO BE A
MULTI-YEAR EFFORT. WE RECOGNIZEGOING IN, PARTICULARLY
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THEIRAQI FORCES WEREN'T
ABLE TO CONTEST THIS THREAT WHENIT APPEARED, HOW MUCH MORE WORK
WE HAVE TO DO ON THE TRAININGSIDE.
BUT AGAIN WE DO HAVE THEFINANCIAL RESOURCES COMING IN,
WE HAVE GOVERNMENT STEPPINGUP TO TRY TO PREVENT THE
FLOW OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS WITHGREATER ENERGY THAN THEY
SADLY BROUGHT TO BEAR INTHE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
>> Jon: WHEN YOU HEAR THEPRESIDENT SAY, WEL WE'RE GOING
SEND IN SOME MORE ADVISORS.WELL, HOW MANY?
WELL, ABOUT 3,000. YOU KNOW,IT GETS REAL VIETNAM-Y TO ME.
IT GETS REAL, YOU KNOW,WE'RE GOING TO SEND IN
3,000 ADVISORS, THAT'SA LOT OF ADVICE.
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK, YOUKNOW, 1,000 ADVISORS, OKAY.
THE OTHER 2,000, THEY'REPROBABLY TROOPS.
>> NO.
WHEN WE SAY ADD ADVISORS,THEY'RE ADVISORS.
I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT TROOPS BEINGDEPLOYED.
>> Jon: LIKE SHOOT THAT GUY --LIKE THAT KIND OF ADVICE?
(LAUGHTER)WHAT? WHAT DO THEY DO?
HOW DO THEY -- WHAT DO THEYADVISE?
>> WELL, THE FORCES HAVE, INCERTAIN AREAS, HAVE DISSOLVED,
SO PART OF IT IS RECONSTITUTION.PART OF IT IS...
>> Jon: THE IRAQI FORCES?
>> THE IRAQI FORCES INPARTICULAR COMMUNITIES.
I MEAN, THEY HIGH-TAILED IT OUTOF, YOU KNOW, MAJOR TOWNS IN THE
NORTHERN PART OF IRAQ SOWE'RE RECONSTITUTING FORCES
AND ALSO THINKING ABOUTDIFFERENT MODELS FOR
DECENTRALIZED SECURITYAPPROACHES. THE THE MODEL
BEFORE WASCENTRALIZED, IT WAS ANIRAQI ARMY AND GIVEN THE
LOYALTIES AS THEY'VE EMERGED,THEY TEND TO BE MORE LOCAL
>> Jon: SO YOU'RE SAYINGYOU'RE TRYING TO FIND A SUNNI
SORT AWAKENING BEEN THE ANBARPROVINCE THAT WOULD TAKE CARE
OF GOVERNANCE SORT OF LIKE ACONFEDERATION.
>> AS WAS DONE BEFORE BUT WHATWAS DONE BEFORE THEN WASN'T
COMPLEMENTED BY LEADERSHIP INBAGHDAD THAT MADE THOSE PEOPLE
FEEL WELCOMED.
>> Jon: CONGRESS, YOU KNOW, IALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THEM TO HAVE A
ROLE IN THIS.
THEY APPEAR NOT TO WANT TO DEALWITH IT.
THEY WERE ON RECESS WHEN WEBEGAN THE OPERATION.
I'M NOT SURE WHERE THEY ARERIGHT NOW.
ARE THEY -- DO THEY HAVE A ROLETO PLAY?
IS THAT ROLE A HELPFUL ROLE ANDHOW MUCH DO YOU HATE THOSE GUYS?
(LAUGHTER)>> LET ME ANSWER THE FIRST
QUESTION.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: ALL RIGHT!
(APPLAUSE)>> THEY HAVE A REALLY IMPORTANT
ROLE TO PLAY. I MEAN,
I HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE U.N. ANDWHEN I TRAVEL OVERSEAS JUST HOW
MUCH MORE POWERFUL OUR MESSAGEIS AND OUR LEADERSHIP IS WHEN
THERE'S A SENSE THAT THECONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
ARE BEHIND US.
SO I THINK THIS IS THE SEASONAND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL
SEE CONGRESS ACT IN SUPPORT OFTHE EFFORT THAT WE'RE
UNDERTAKING BOTH IN TERMSOF I.S.I.L AND EBOLA WHERE
REAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDEDTO BE DEPLOYED.
>> Jon: IN YOUR ANSWER I SEESOMETHING.
>> DIPLOMACY?>> Jon: BOY OH BOY, YOU'RE NOT
KIDDING. THAT WAS SUPERDIPLOMACY.
THAT WAS AMBASSADOR-IFIC.>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: BUTTHANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.
>> THANK YOU.>> AND CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK,
AND I HOPE THINGS WORK OUTESPECIALLY IN THE AFRICAN
REGION.
AMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANK YOU.
