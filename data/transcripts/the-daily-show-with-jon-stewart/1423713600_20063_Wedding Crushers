BUT LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT, YOUKNOW, AS YOU KNOW OUR COUNTRY
HAS BEEN MAKING VERY POSITIVESTRIDES ON LGBT EQUALITY BUT
DON'T WORRY, KANSAS ISTRYING TO FIX THAT.
>> IN KANSAS GOVERNOR SAMBROWNBACK HAS ISSUED AN
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REMOVELEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR GAY,
LESBIAN AND TRANSGENDEREMPLOYEES.
THAT MEANS STATE WORKERS CANNOW LEGALLY BE FIRED,
HARASSED OR DENIED A JOBBASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION
AND GENDER IDENTITY.
>> Jon: THERE YOU GO, INKANSAS IT WAS NOT LEGAL FOR
STATE EMPLOYEES TO BE FIREDOR HARASSED BECAUSE THEY
WERE GAY.
NOW GOVERNOR SAM BROWNBACKTHOUGHT, I NEED TO RECTIFY
THAT.
I CAN GET IN TROUBLE FORFIRING OR HARASSING A
LESBIAN?
THIS CANNOT STAND.
AND IT BEING KANSAS, I GUESSBROWNBACK CLICKED HIS HEELS
THREE TIMES AND SAID THEREIS NO PLACE LIKE HOMOPHOBIA.
YOU KNOW-- (APPLAUSE)
I GOT TO ASK, WE SAW, WESAW HOW THE NAME SANTORUM
GOT REDEFINED DUE TO HISPOSITION ON GAY RIGHTS.
YOU ARE REALLY TELLING ME WECAN'T DO BETTER WITH THE
ALMOST ALREADY THERE NAMEBROWNBACK?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)COME ON, INTERNET!
OF COURSE, IT ISN'T ALL BADNEWS FOR GAY PEOPLE LIVING
IN STATES WHERE YOU MIGHTNOT EXPECT THEM TO BE.
>> SAME SEX COUPLES BEGANGETTING LICENCES IN ALABAMA
AFTER A FEDERAL JUDGE TWOWEEKS AGO STRUCK DOWN A
STATE BAN ON GAY MARRIAGETHERE.
>> Jon: GREAT JOB, ALABAMA.
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?
YES, I GET TO PUT A QUARTERIN THE GREAT JOB ALABAMA
JAR.
(LAUGHTER)(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW THE STATE OF ALABAMA DIDASK THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT TO GRANT ASTAY ON ANY GAY MARRIAGES
WHILE THE DECISION IS BEINGAPPEALED.
>> JUST WITHIN THE LASTCOUPLE OF MINUTES THE
SUPREME COURT APPARENTLY BYA VOTE OF 7-2 DECLINED TO
GRANT THAT STAY.
>> JUSTICES ANTONIN ANDSCALIA AND CLARENCE THOMAS
SAID TODAY.
>> OHMYGOD,OHMYGOD, OHMYGOD IKNOW WHAT THEY SAID.
I KNOW TOTALLY WHAT THEY SAID.
SCALIA AND THOMAS ARE FINALLYGETTING HITCHED.
IS THAT WAHT THIS IS?
WHAT WILL THEY WEAR?
WHAT IS THEIR COUPLE NAMEGOING TO BE?
I'M GOING GO WITH SCALOMAS.SCALOMAS.
SCLARENCE THOMATIN. ANTONYMSCONCE-THOM.
CLARISSE TAMATOMANIN.
NINSICT SCOMLIOSE.
SKROM LEE OWES.
ANTONIO BAN-SCLARENCE.
CLARITIN NON-DROWSY.
UNLESS WE'RE GETTING GAYMARRIED ISN'T WHAT THOMAS
AND SCALIA SAID.
>> JUSTICES ANTONIN SCALIAAND CLARENCE THOMAS SAID
TODAY THE SUPREME COURTSHOULD HAVE GRANTED
ALABAMA'S REQUEST TO PUTTHAT RULING ON HOLD.
>> Jon: MELATONINCHLAMYDIA I AM SHOCKED.
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW THOSEGUYS FEEL BECAUSE
THE STAY WAS NOT GRANTED.
UNLESS YOU DON'T HAPPEN TOHAVE A STATE SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE WHO SOMEHOW THINKS HEOUTRANKED THE
FEDERAL SUPREME COURT.
>> CHIEF JUSTICE ROY MOORE OFTHE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT
ORDERED THE STATE'S PROBATEJUDGES NOT TO ISSUE
MARRIAGE LICENSES.
>> TELLING THEM THAT THEY DIDN'THAVE TO FOLLOW A FEDERAL
JUDGE'S RULING DECLARING THESTATE'S BAN ON SAME SEX
MARRIAGE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
>> Jon: HUH.
SO, AN ALABAMA OFFICIALCIRCUMVENTING A FEDERAL
RULING IN ORDER TO RESTRICT THECIVIL RIGHTS OF A MINORITY
POPULATION. I GUESSHE WAS THINKING,
HEY, THAT "SELMA"MOVIE WAS A HIT.
BETTER START LAYING THEGROUNDWORK FOR A SEQUEL.
>> WELL, JUDGE MOORE IS MAKINGAN OLD STATE'S RIGHTS CASE THAT
ARTICLE 6, CLAUSE 2 OF THECONSTITUTION CLEARLY REFUTES.
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TOHAVE OTHER LESS LEGAL-ISH
REASONS TO DO THIS, WOULDYOU?
>> I THINK THE REDEFINITIONOF THE WORD MARRIAGE IS NOT
FOUND WITHIN THE POWERSDESIGNATED TO THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.
DID THEY STOP WITH ONE MANAND ONE MAN OR ONE WOMAN AND
ONE WOMAN, OR DO THEY GO TOMULTIPLE MARRIAGES?
OR DO THEY GO WITH MARRIAGESBETWEEN MEN AND THEIR
DAUGHTERS OR WOMEN AND THEIRSONS?
>> IT'S ALL IN THE JUDGE'SBOOK, A THOUSAND AND ONE
THINGS MARRIAGE EQUALITYWILL IN NO WAY IMPACT BUT
SOMEHOW STILL SCARE THE [BLEEP]OUT OF ME THE ACTUAL CHIEF
JUSTICE OF AN AMERICAN STATEIN 2015.
IT'S A LONG TITLE THAT I REALLY[BLEEP] UP AS I WAS SAYING IT.
ANYWAY, THE POINT ISTHIS.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THEUNLICKLY POSSIBILITY OF SOME
FARROFF FUTURE WHERE PEOPLEGET MARRIED IN GROUPS.
THIS IS ABOUT REAL PEOPLE WHOSELIVES ARE BEING AFFECTED BY
THIS RIGHT NOW.
>> IN MOBILE, MILTONPERSINGER FACED A CLOSED
WINDOW.
>> I SHOULD ALREADY BE HOMECELEBRATING BUT NO, I'M
SITTING HERE WONDERING WHATIN THE WORLD ARE THESE
PEOPLE THINKING.
>> Jon: OH, WELL, I THINK THEMARTI GRAS STICKERS ON
THAT CLOSED WINDOW GIVE YOUA SENSE OF WHAT THOSE PEOPLE
ARE THINKING.
THEY ARE THINKING, WE COMPLETELYNORMAL HETEROSEXUALS TOTALLY
ACCEPT TRANSFORMING THEBEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN
SEASON OF LENT INTO A TIT FORBEAD BACCHANAL,
BUT WE CAN'T ALLOWYOU TWO GENTLEMAN TO GET
MARRIED BECAUSE THAT'S WEIRD.
COME ON, ALABAMA.
LET'S AT LEAST BE HONESTABOUT THE REAL REASON THAT
YOU ARE DOING THIS.
>> MY MAYOR'S PROBATE OFFICE ISNOT GOING TO BE IN THE
MARRIAGE LICENCE BUSINESSALL TOGETHER.
WE DECIDED TO TAKE OURSELVESOUT OF THAT.
WE DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINTANYBODY BUT AT THE SAME TIME
YOU'VE GOT THOSE DEEPLY HELDCHRISTIAN BELIEFS THAT I DO.
>> WOAH, WAIT A MINUTE.
SO IN THE MINDS OF THESE JUDGESAND CLERK, BIBLICAL LAW
SUPERSEDES FEDERAL LAW.
WHICH REMINDS ME, WHAT WASTHAT STATE CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT THAT ALABAMAVOTERS PASSED LAST YEAR BY A
HUGE MARGIN.
>> SOME PEOPLE REFER TOAMENDMENT ONE AS THE SHARIA
LAW AMENDMENT.
IT WOULD PROHIBIT JUDGES ANDOTHER STATE OFFICIALS FROM
BASING ANY OF THEIRDECISIONS ON FOREIGN LAW.
>> Jon: HMMMM, WHERE WAS THEBIBLE WRITTEN AGAIN?
(LAUGHTER)LAST TIME I CHECKED ANCIENT
GALILEE IS NOT-- (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
ANCIENT GALILEE ISNOT ONE OF THE 50 STATES.
OR EVEN ONE OF THEMTERRITORIES THAT NOBODY
KNOWS ABOUT.
WHICH MAKES IT FOREIGN LAW.
THE KIND OF FOREIGN LAW YOUEXPLICITLY BANNED FROM
JUDICIAL DECISIONS.
YOU HAVE [BLEEP] YOURSELVESWITH YOUR OWN STATUTE.
OR AS I HOPE IT BECOMES TOBE KNOWN, BROWNBACKING.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
