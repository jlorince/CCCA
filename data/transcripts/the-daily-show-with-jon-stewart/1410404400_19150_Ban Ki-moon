>> Jon: WELCOME BACK. MY GUESTTONIGHT, HE IS THE
SECRETARY-GENERAL OFTHE UNITED NATIONS,
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL BANKI-MOON.
(APPLAUSE)THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY HAVEBETTER THINGS TO DO.
>> IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE FORME TO BE PARTICIPATING IN
THIS SHOW.
>> Jon: WE WANT TO MAKE SURETHAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE.
IN YOUR CAREER, IN YOUR LIFE,CAN YOU RECALL A MORE DIRE
TIME FOR THE HUMANCONDITION?
IS THAT HOW IT STRIKES YOUNOW?
ARE YOU AN OPTIMIST?
>> FOR MANY YEARS TRAGICSITUATIONS WHERE I FEEL VERY
SAD, PARTICULARLY WHEN U.N.
PEACEKEEPERS ARE KILLED,WHEN THERE'S A HUGE, SERIOUS
VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
MANY WOMEN AND GIRLS BEINGKILLED ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TOPROTECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS.
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANTIMPORTANT-- OF THE UNITED
NATIONS. THAT IS ONE OF MYSTRONGEST MANDATES BY THE
CHARTER OF THE UNITEDNATIONS. OF COURSE WE HAVE TO
KEEP PEACE AND SECURITY, ALLAROUND THE WORLD.
>> Jon: IS THERE -- HOWDIFFICULT IS IT TO RALLY THE
WORLD TO THESE CAUSES?
BECAUSE WE SEE THISSITUATION BOKO HARAM IN
NIGERIA, ISIS, SYRIA,UKRAINE, GAZA, ALL AROUND
THE WORLD.
IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK THEU.N. TO-- TO-- OR IS IT
BETTER FOR THE U.N. TO KEEPFOCUSED ON HUMANITARIAN
ISSUES AND TRY AND SORT OUTTHE MORE POLITICAL ISSUES
LATER.
OR CAN YOU ACCOMPLISH BOTH?
>> I THINK WE ARE LIVING INAN ERA OF MULTIPLE CRISES.
A LOT OF CRISES ARE TAKING,AT THE SAME TIME, ALL AROUND
THE WORLD.
WE HAVE A SERIOUS SITUATIONIN SYRIA WHICH HAS BEEN
CONTINUING FOR THREE YEARS,WITH WELL OVER 20,000 PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN KILLED.
NOW WE HAVE A SERIOUS TERRORISTATTACKS IN IRAQ AND SOUTH OF
SUDAN IN CENTRAL AFRICAREPUBLIC.
AND IN GAZA WE HAVE SEEN SOMUCH DEVASTATION.
THEREFORE, WE NEED TO REALLYPROTECT THE CIVILIAN
POPULATIONS.
AND I HAVE BEEN TRAVELINGALL OF THESE HOT SPOTS,
WITHOUT EXCEPTION, ALLAROUND THE WORLD.
SOMETIMES I HAVE TO PROTECTMYSELF.
AND I KNOW THAT YOU CONDUCT ALOT OF DIFFICULT INTERVIEWS,
MEETING WITH THE DIFFERENTPEOPLE, I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
THIS U.N. PEACEKEEPING HELMET TOPROTECT YOURSELF.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> KEEP IT HANDY BECAUSE-- I
MAY NEED IT FOR MYPROTECTION.
>> Jon: YES. OKAY.
IS THIS YOUR WAY OF TELLINGME I'M BEING SHIPPED OUT
SOMEWHERE?
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
BUT IT DOES, YOU KNOW, BOY, ITBRINGS UP A SERIOUS
SITUATION, THOUGH.
HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO GETWORLD OPINION ON ANY
SITUATION?
AND DOES THE U.N. HAVE TOCONTRACT IN SOME WAYS TO BE
MORE EFFECTIVE IN CERTAINSITUATIONS OR CAN IF
CONTINUE TO-- AND WHO WITHINTHE U.N. ORGANIZATION, AND
YOU DON'T HAVE TONECESSARILY NAME NAMES BUT
WHICH COUNTRY IS THE BIGGESTPAIN IN THE BUTT?
(LAUGHTER)>> WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS
MEMBER STATES ARE UNITED...>> Jon: YEAH.
>> UNITED NATIONS SHOULD BEUNITED.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THERE ARE SOME CASESTHAT THE MEMBER STATES ARE
NOT UNITED AND DIVIDED.
IN SUCH CASE WE HAVE ASERIOUS PROBLEM, AS WE ARE
SEEING IN SYRIA.
BUT WHEN THERE IS A UNITY OFOPINION AND POSITION, WE CAN
ADDRESS ALL THESE ISSUES.THIS IS THE UNSPEAKABLE
TERRORIST ATTACKS...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND CRIMES WHICH ARE NOWBEING COMMITTED IN IRAQ AND
SYRIA, AND ELSEWHERE.
I THINK WE HAVE TO UNITE ANDWE HAVE TO SHOW STRONG
SOLIDARITY TO ADDRESS THIS ONE.
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, THATALL THE COUNTRIES, WHOEVER
MAY HAVE CAPACITY, ORINFLUENCE, SHOULD DO IT.
>> Jon: SEE, THAT BRINGS UP AGOOD POINT.
SO SYRIA, CLEARLY GASSINGTHEIR OWN PEOPLE, TERRIBLE
DEVASTATION, THEY'REBOMBING.
BUT THE SECURITY COUNCILCOULD NOT COME TO AN
AGREEMENT ON-- NOW THERE WASA WAY OF DISARMING THEM OF
THEIR CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND ITHINK YOU ARE LOOKING INTO
THERE IS A NEW REPORT ONTHAT.
BUT IS THERE ANYTHING ANYMORE, OTHER THAN, YOU KNOW,
EBOLA IS BAD, OR WE NEED TO HELPTHEM, YOU KNOW,
HUMANITARIAN TYPE ISSUES,WHERE YOU WILL GET THE TYPE
OF AGREEMENT THAT YOU NEED.
AND EVEN WHEN RESOLUTIONSARE PASSED, DO PEOPLE JUST
IGNORE THEM?
IS THERE STILL THE RESPECTFOR THE UNITED NATIONS AS AN
INSTITUTION, AND THE TEETHBEHIND IT TO MAKE THAT
EFFECTIVE?
>> OVERALL, YOU SHOULD HAVEGREAT RESPECT AND
APPRECIATION FOR WHAT UNITEDNATIONS HAS BEEN DOING FOR
MAINTAINING PEACE ANDSECURITY.
AND DEVELOPMENT FOR POORPEOPLE, AND ALSO HUMAN
RIGHTS.
I THINK WE HAVE DONE A GREATJOB DURING THE LAST 70 YEARS.
BUT IN THE CASE OF SYRIA ORSOME OTHER AREAS, WHEN THE
SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARENOT UNITED, THEN WE ARE
SEEING THATTRAGIC SITUATION CONTINUING.
THAT WE HAVE TO PREVENT.
THAT IS WHY I'M ASKING THATWE HAVE TO RALLY BEHIND THE
CHARTER OF THE UNITEDNATIONS, UNITED NATIONS
FLAGS.
WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY CASESOF EXTREMISM, RADICALISM...
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND TERRORISM.
AND NOT A SINGLE COUNTRY ORPERSON CAN HANDLE THIS
ONE.
AS THE SECRETARY OF GENERALOF THE UNITED NATIONS-- I
CANNOT-- .
>> Jon: I LIKE THAT YOU WENTFOR YOUR NAME PLATE.
>> WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OFTHE MEMBER STATES,
BUT I'M REALLY DOING...
>> Jon: HOW DOES PRESSURETHEN, HOW DO WE PUT PRESSURE
ON NATION STATES WHEN THEYFEEL A CERTAIN IMPUNITY.
CERTAINLY THE UNITED NATIONS,THE UNITED STATES VETOES
RESOLUTIONS WHEN IT'S NOT INTHEIR INTERESTS.
RUSSIA DOES THE SAME.
CHINA CAN DO IT.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVETHESE LARGE SUPERPOWERS THAT
HAVE THE ABILITY TO -- YOUHAVE YOUR GLOBAL WARMING
INITIATIVES...>> YES.
>> Jon: THAT HAVE NOTBEEN ABLE TO BE NECESSARILY
IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE OF OURINABILITY TO COME TO
AGREEMENT ON IT.
OR DOES THAT HELP YOU?
DO YOU THINK TO YOURSELF,BOY, WITH ALL THE TERRIBLE
THINGS IN THE WORLD WE'LLALL BE UNDER WATER IN 200
YEARS ANYWAY SO WHO CARES.
>> SOME PEOPLE MAY THINKTHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS ALL
THE POWERS.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT I THINK IT'S THE PEOPLE.
IT'S THE PEOPLE.
THE CIVIL SOCIETY, NGOs,THEY HAVE NOW MORE POWER,
MORE VOICE, I THINK,PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY
SHOULD RAISE THEIR VOICES, LOOK,MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS MY
WORLD.
I'M GOING TO LIVE IN THISWORLD SO PLEASE MAKE THIS
WORLD SAFE AND PROSPEROUSAND WHERE EVERYBODY'S HUMAN
DIGNITY IS RESPECTED.
I THINK THEY HAVE THEIRLEGITIMATE PEROGATIVE, RIGHTS.
THAT IS WHY I'M ASKING OURYOUNG GENERATION, YOU HAVE
ALL THE TOOLS, LIKE SOCIALMEDIA, THAT THEY CAN, YOU
KNOW, GENERATE A STRONGPOWER ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
SO RAISE YOUR VOICE.
>> Jon: DO YOU STILL BELIEVEIN THE IDEALISM THAT CAN
RISE UP AND SNUFF OUT THETYPES OF EXTREMISM THAT
WE'VE BEEN SEEING.
YOU ARE STILL AN OPTIMIST?
>> WE HAVE TO WORK AND WEHAVE TO ADDRESS THEM.
WE HAVE TO BE UNITED.
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, IN THENAME OF HUMANITY.
HOW CAN THEY BE SO BRUTAL? HOWCAN THEY BE SO CRUEL,
AS A HUMAN BEING.>> Jon: YES.
>> WE HAVE ADDRESS THISONE. I'M ASKING WHOLE WORLD,
REGARDLESS OF POLITICALIDEOLOGY ONE MAY HAVE.
WE HAVE TO UNITE IN THE NAMEOF HUMANITY.
>> WELL, YOU WOULD HOPE THAT WEWILL GET TO THAT TIPPING POINT
AND THERE WILL BE THAT TYPE OFGROUNDSWELL.
AND I APPRECIATE YOU VERYMUCH FOR BEING HERE.
I KNOW ARE YOU HAVE ATREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO
DO.
YOU MAY KEEP THIS.
