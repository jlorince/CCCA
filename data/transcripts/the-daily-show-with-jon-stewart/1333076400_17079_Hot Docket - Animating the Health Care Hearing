ARE WE GOING TO BALANCE THIS.
I BELIEVE THE OBAMACARE SUPPORTERS MAY HAVE MADE THE MISTAKE OF BRINGING A
PROVISION TO A PRINCIPLES FIGHT.
SO LET'S SEE HOW THE COURT VIEWS IT.
NOW UNFORTUNATE LEIGH CAMERAS ARE NOT ALLOWED AT THE SUPREME COURT SO WE
CAN'T SHOW YOU VIDEO OF THE HEARING.
I CAN ONLY ASSUME THEY BEGAN WITH A SELLOUT CROWD FILING IN.
AND THEN PROMPTLY AT 10 A.M.
THE 9 JUSTICES SLIDE DOWN INTO PLACE, A PACKED GALLERY OF JOURNALISTS, INTERESTED
PARTIES AND OF COURSE MARK'S MOST BELOVED JUDGE CEE-LO.
(LAUGHTER) HE'S THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF OUR HEARTS.
HAT TIP TO OUR FRIENDS THE IMAGINEEERS AT THE TAIWANESE ANIMATION STUDIO.
(LAUGHTER) LET'S SEE HOW THAT REDUCTIVE OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM SCREAMING MATCH PLAYS OUT
INSIDE THE COURTROOM.
>> INSURANCE HAS BECOME THE PREDOMINANT MEANS OF PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY.
BUT FOR MORE THAN 40 MILLION AMERICANS, WITHOUT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH
INSURANCE, THE SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK.
>> THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS ALL POWERS.
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A GOVERNMENT OF LIMITED POWERS.
>> Jon: WHAT, WHAT WHAT, YES,
NO WONDER THEY DON'T WANT CAMERAS IN THERE, THAT SHOW SUCKS.
I GUESS BASICALLY WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS THE GOVERNMENT SEES A PROBLEM, THAT PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE.
AND THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING ATHAT IN ORDER FOR ALL PEOPLE TO BE COVERED AND FOR
PRIVATE INSURANCE TO NOT GO BANKRUPT BY COVERING ALL PEOPLE THEY MUST HAVE A PAN
DATE FROM THE GOVERNMENT THAT EVERYONE HAS TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE.
AND SCALIA IS SAYING YEAH-- YOU KNOW, MAYBE THAT WOULD FIX IT BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT,
[BLEEP] BUT WHAT WAS SO INTERESTING WAS WATCHING BOTH SIDES TAKE THAT ARGUMENT TO THEIR LOGICAL CONCLUSION.
TO SEE THE EXACT POINT WHERE THE ARGUMENTS BEGIN TALKING PAST EACH OTHER.
>> IN THE HEALTH-CARE MARKET ARE YOU GOING INTO THE MARKET WITHOUT THE ABILITY
TO PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET,
GETTING THE HEALTH-CARE SERVICE ANYWAY AS A RESULT OF THE SOCIAL NORMS THAT
ALLOW, THAT, TO WHICH WE'VE OBLIGATED OURSELVES.
>> DON'T OBLIGATE YOURSELF TO THAT.
>> Jon: THAT RIGHT THERE,
DID YOU HEAR IT.
DON'T OBLIGATE YOURSELF TO THAT.
THE GUY ON THE GOVERNMENT SIDE IS TWISTING HIMSELF INTO PRETZEL TO FIND A WAY
TO PAY FOR THE PREVIOUSLYLY UNINSURED 40 MILLION PEOPLE THAT GET EMERGENCY ROOM CARE
BUT CAN'T PAY FOR IT WELL,
TAKE THIS OVER HERE, TAKE SOME FAT OUT OF THE ASS PUT IT IN THE LIPS.
AND THE OTHER GUY IS LIKE HAVE YOU TRIED, I DON'T KNOW
[BLEEP] WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?
IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF WHAT IS FREEDOM AND SOCIETY IS.
THAT'S-- YOU HAVE TO WONDER HOW IT IS THAT THE PARTY THAT CREATIONISTS CALL HOME
IS SO DARWINNIAN.
THAT'S THE CRAZY PART.
THIS IS THE WAY THE ARGUMENTS WENT.
THE LIBERAL JUDGES CLINGING TO THEIR MOST PRECIOUS VALUES.
THE CONSERVATIVE JUDGES CLINGING TO THEIR MOST PRECIOUS VALUES.
AND THAT BASICALLY JUST LEFT THE LAWYERS TAKING TURNS FIGHTING OVER THE ONLY SWING
VOTE ON THE PANEL JUSTICE KENNEDY.
(LAUGHTER) I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW WHY ONE SIDE TRIES TO BUY HIM YOU HAVE A AND THE OTHER
SIDE JUST GIVES HIM ICE CREAM.
ANYWAY, ULTIMATELY WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THE THREE-DAYS OF ARGUMENT?
WHO WON THE COURT CASE OF FREEDOM V SOCIAL CONTRACT.
>> THIS WAS A TRAIN WRECK.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HAILT CARE-- HEALTH CARE LAW COULD BE ON LIFE-SUPPORT.
>> AND IT MAY ALSO BE A PLANE WRECK (LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: AND DOWN GOES SOCIAL CONTRACT.
8, 9, 10, IT'S OVER!
THANK GOD, THE DISASTER OF THAT WASN'T CAPTURED BY CAMERAS, AS LADY LIBERTY--  (LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: JUST TOOK A-- OH MY GOD.
(LAUGHTER)
[BLEEP] BIDEN
