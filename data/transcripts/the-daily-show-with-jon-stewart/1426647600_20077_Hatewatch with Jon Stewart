I'M GONNA ANNOUNCEOFFICIALLY THAT I'LL BE
HOSTING A NEW SHOW FORC-SPAN CALLED
"HATEWATCH WITH JON STEWART."
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)HERE'S A SNEAK PREVIEW.

C-SPAN'S NEW SHOW, "HATEWATCH."
THEN AT 11:30 P.M., ON BOOK TV,AUTHOR MICHIO KAKU DISCUSSES THE
CHALLENGES OF WRITING A MEMOIRWHEN THERE'S A BEE TRAPPED IN
YOUR OFFICE.
>> HI, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO "HATEWATCH" ON C-SPAN2, I'M JON STEWART.
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A LOOK TODAYAND SEE WHAT OUR CONGRESS IS UP
TO?
>> A BIPARTISAN BILL TO PROVIDEASSISTANCE TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING
VICTIMS AND ADDITIONAL RESOURCESTO LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS GOTTEN
STUCK IN THE SENATE.
>> Jon: MOTHER -- SO IT APPEARSTHE SENATE IS STUCK ON A BILL
I'M SURE EVERY AMERICAN WHO'SNOT CURRENTLY ACTIVELY INVOLVED
IN TRAFFICKING HUMANS FORSEX WOULD SUPPORT.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING IWOULD HATE.
TELL ME MORE.
>> DEMOCRATS HAD JOINEDREPUBLICANS IN UNANIMOUS SUPPORT
OF THE BILL IN COMMITTEE BUT ARENOW FIGHTING TO STRIP
OUT HYDE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE.
>> Jon: AH YES, THE HYDEAMENDMENT, NAMED FOR THE ACTION
THAT REPUBLICANS APPARENTLY HAVETO TAKE TO GET THE ANTI-ABORTION
LANGUAGE INTO ALL BILLS. LET'SHIDE IT OVER HERE, LET'S HIDE IT
OVER -- THE HYDE AMENDMENTBLOCKS THE USE OF FEDERAL MONEY
FOR ABORTIONS, BECAUSE JUSTBECAUSE A PROCEDURE IS
COMPLETELY LEGAL DOESN'T MEAN ITHAS TO BE TREATED THAT WAY.
I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED, A LITTLEBIT OF REPUBLICAN WHAT WE AT
C-SPAN TWO CALL (BLEEP)RY.
HOW DID THE SEX TRAFFICKING BILLGET PASSED COMMITTEE
WITHOUT ANY NOT REPUBLICANSCOMPLAINING.
>> DEMOCRATS DO ADMIT THAT WHENTHIS BILL WENT THROUGH THE
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEEAND WAS APPROVED BY BOTH
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS,
THEY DIDN'T READ IT FULLY.
>> Jon: YOU DIDN'T READ ITFULLY.
WHAT, DID YOU JUST SKIM IT TOSEE IF YOUR NAME WAS MENTIONED?
MOM!
I'M IN THE BILL!
>> WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS IN THEBILL.
YOU CAN BLAME IT ON STAFF, BLAMEIT ON WHOEVER YOU WANT TO BLAME
IT ON.
>> Jon: HOW ABOUT I BLAME NOTREADING THE BILL ON YOU?
SENATOR HARRY REID, THE GUY INCHARGE OF SENATE DEMOCRATS WHOSE
LAST NAME IS LITERALLY" REID ."
HOW DID YOU NOT READ THIS BILL?
IT'D BE LIKE GOING TO JOHNWATERS' HOUSE AND FINDING OUT
ALL OF HIS PLANTS ARE DEAD.
JOHN, WHY DIDN'T YOU YOUR LASTNAME THEM!
WELL, IT APPEARS (BLEEP)ERY ANDDUMBASSERY ARE RUNNING NECK
AND NECK TO STYMIE THE HUMAN SEXTRAFFICKING BILL
EVERYONE AGREES SHOULD BE A LAW.
AS REPRESENTED HERE BY SAID(BLEEP) AND DUMBASSES.
>> A REPUBLICAN JUDICIARYCOMMITTEE STAFFER SENT A
DEMOCRATIC STAFFER A SUMMARYOF CHANGES TO THE PREVIOUS
VERSION OF THE BILL IN SEVENBULLET POINTS.
GUESS WHAT.
THEY LEFT OUT THE CHANGE THEYMADE.
>> REPUBLICANS ANNOUNCING THATTRUSTING THEM WAS A MISTAKE.
>> Jon: REALLY? YOU THINK?
YOU THINK THAT TRUSTING THEREPUBLICANS WAS A MISTAKE
YOU KNOW WHO THAT'S ON?
IT'S THE SAME WAY NOBODY BLAMESTHE BEARS IN "GRIZZLY MAN" FOR
EATING THE DELICIOUS-LOOKINGMEAT SACK WHO KEPT STICKING HIS
HANDS IN THEIR POOP.BECAUSE THEY'RE BEARS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, PERHAPSNOW IT'S TIME ON
"HATEWATCH" TO GO TO THEPHONES.
>> "HATEWATCH" PHONECALLS SPONSORED BY ARBY'S.
ARBY'S, BRINGINGWASHINGTON-STYLE GRIDLOCK
TO YOUR COLON.
>> Jon: JUST CALL THE NUMBERON YOUR SCREEN, CALL TO GET IN
ON OUR -- (LAUGHTER)
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE OUR FIRSTCALLER.
NOW OBVIOUSLY SINCE THIS ISC-SPAN THE CALLER WILL PROBABLY
BE A NON-SCREENED, UNAPOLOGETICRACIST. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.
>> Caller: JON, CLEARLY THEPROBLEM HERE IS BLACK PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE AN AMERICAN WORKETHIC AND CAN'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND CIVILIZATION, SO ASLONG AS PRESIDENT BROKE O'BUMMER
IS IN OFFICE OPPRESSING WHITEPEOPLE --
>> Jon: OKAY GOODBYE.
LET'S RETURN TO OUR EXAMINATIONOF HOW A BIPARTISAN SEX
TRAFFICKING BILL IS STUCK IN THESENATE.
I BELIEVE MAJORITY LEADER MITCHMCCONNELL WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
A DISINGENUOUS POINT.
>> LET'S NOT FILIBUSTERBIPARTISAN HELP FOR VULNERABLE
VICTIMS JUST TO MAKE A POINT FORLEFT-WING SPECIAL INTEREST
GROUPS.
>> Jon: HOW DARE -- THE ONLYREASON THE LANGUAGE IS IN THERE
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE BOWING DOWN TORIGHT-WING SPECIAL INTEREST --
YOU KNOW, SON OF A BITCH!
I WANNA -- LET ME TELL YOUSOMETHING!
TURTLE MAN!
I, YOU KNOW WHAT -- I JUST, INEED A MOMENT.
I NEED A MOMENT.
>> UP NEXT WE'LL TRAIN OURCAMERAS ON AN EMPTY PODIUM LONG
BEFORE ANYONE APPROACHESIT TO SPEAK.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. I'M OKAY, I'MOKAY. ALL RIGHT.
UNLESS SENATOR MCCONNELL ISABOUT TO IN THE IMMEDIATE
AFTERMATH OF COMPLAINING THATTHE DEMOCRATS ARE USING AN
UNRELATED ISSUE TO HOLD UPIMPORTANT SENATE BUSINESS --
HOLD UP IMPORTANT SENATEBUSINESS WITH AN UNRELATED
ISSUE.
>> SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCHMCCONNELL SAYS HE WILL PUT OFF A
CONFIRMATION VOTE ON ATTORNEYGENERAL NOMINEE LORETTA LYNCH
UNTIL THE SENATE PASSES A HUMANTRAFFICKING BILL.
>> Jon: YOU'RE DOING THESAME THING -- HELP!
HELP! HELP!
>> WE NOW REJOIN LIVE AREENACTMENT OF A CIVIL WAR
BOOK PANEL.
>> BLAH, BLAH, BLAH GETTYSBURG.
>> OH SO WITTY, NORTH FREEDOM,BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
>> LOOK AT MY HAIR, I'M SOOLD I WEAR A BOW TIE!
>> FASCINATING...
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT. WELL,IT APPEARS THE FAILURE OF THE
SEX TRAFFICKING BILL TO PASS
THE SENATE WOULD SEAL THEVICTORY FOR (BLEEP)RY IN THIS
CASE BUT WE WON'T SURE UNTIL THEVOTE ON THE
SENATE FLOOR ACCOMPANIED BYCLASSICAL MUSIC TO MAKE YOU FEEL
SMART.
(MUSIC)>> Jon: ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW
WHAT, THIS IS JUSTTAKING TOO LONG.
I'M GONNA MAKE ANOTHERANNOUNCEMENT.
SIX AND A HALF MINUTES AGO,C-SPAN 2 GAVE ME AN INCREDIBLE
OPPORTUNITY TO HOST THIS SHOW.
BUT I THINK NOW IT'S TIME FORSOMEONE ELSE, ANYONE ELSE.
"HATEWATCH" DOESN'T DESERVE AHOST WHO'S EVEN SLIGHTLY
NAUSEOUS.
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'LL BELEAVING "HATEWATCH."
OH YES, I DO.
RIGHT (BLEEP) NOW.
WOW!
THAT WAS A NIGHTMARE!
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!
