I GUESS, FOUND ITUNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THE SUPREME
COURT SAID, WELL, YEAH, BUTTHEY'RE SO USED TO IT NOW --

AFTER HEARING A FULL TRIAL ONTHIS ISSUE, FOUND THAT IT WAS
THE MODERN-DAY VERSION OF A POLLTAX.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> WHICH IT IS, BECAUSE SO
MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THEUNDERLYING DOCUMENTATION TO BE
ABLE TO GET THAT PHOTO I.D. ANDBE ABLE TO VOTE.

GUN PERMIT IS, YES?

HOW CONSERVATIVE IS TEXAS ANDWHAT IS THE DEMOGRAPHIC?
YOU KNOW, WE'VE HEARD A LOTABOUT IT'S FLIPPIN' BLUE.
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT AIN'T EVENA FLIPPIN' LIKE A COOL AZURE.
LIKE IT'S NOT EVEN -- WHAT'SGOING ON?
>> IT'S ON ITS WAY. IT REALLY ISON IT'S WAY. AND WHAT WE'VE
SUFFERED FROM HERE FOR QUITE AWHILE IS TWO DECADES
OF REPUBLICAN-LED REDISTRICTINGTHAT HAVE CREATED VERY PURELY
DRAWN REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS AND AFEW VERY PURELY DRAWN DEMOCRATIC
ONES. AND SO ALL OF THECONVERSATIONS IN ELECTIONS TAKE
PLACE DURING PRIMARIES. AND ITWAS ONE OF THE REASONS I WAS SO
COMMITTED TO THIS RACE. MAKINGSURE THAT WE WERE GOING TO FORCE
INTO A GENERAL ELECTION A REALCONVERSATION ABOUT THE THINGS
THAT REALLY MATTERED TO PEOPLEAND INVITE TEXAS TO DECIDE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> WHETHER THIS REPUBLICAN-LED
LEGISLATURE TRULY IS REFLECTIVEOF THE THINGS THAT THEY
CARE ABOUT, LIKE MAKING SURETHAT THEIR SCHOOLS ARE
FUNDED AFTER THEY WATCHED $5.5BILLION BEING CUT.
>> Jon: WHAT WERE THEY DOING --$5.5 BILLION? I'LL TELL YA,
I WAS SHOCKED WHEN THEY SAIDTHEY WERE TRYING TO CUT
$5.5 BILLION FROMEDUCATION IN TEXAS.
I HAD NO IDEA YOU SPENT ANYWHERENEAR THAT.
