NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY.
GREAT ANOTHER GINNED UP DISTRACTION PULLING FOCUS FROM THE SEQUESTER BUDGET CUTS.
WHY IS THERE NO BILL?
MR. TANGERINE MAN, WRITE A BILL FOR ME.
>> WE HAVE MOVED A BILL IN THE HOUSE TWICE.
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MOVE A THIRD BILL BEFORE THE SENATE GETS OFF THEIR ASS AND BEGINS TO
DO SOMETHING.
>> Jon: YES, MR. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES YOU'VE HAD AN UP-OR-DOWN VOTE.
WHY HASN'T THE SENATE DONE THE SAME?
IS IT BECAUSE THE ARE NOT PARTY, THE REPUBLICANS, WON'T ALLOW IT.
>> I WANT TO ASK BUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT HAPPENED TODAY JOHN BOEHNER USING COLORFUL LANGUAGE.
>> USE OF THE WORD ASS, THAT WORD ASS.
>> GET OFF HIS ASS.
>> USE OF THE WORD LIKE THAT INAPPROPRIATE OR FINE?
>> COMING OUT OF THE ASS.
>> OF THE ASS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: HE SAID ASS.
(bleep).
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'M SORRY BUT WHEN DID THE TOUGH EDGED CORPORATE MEDIA BECOME SUCH DELICATE FLOWERS.
OH, YOU SAID THE WORD REGRET AND I'M AFRAID FOR MY LIFE AND NOW THAT DREADFUL ORANGE MAN IS
SPEAKING IN VULGARITIES.
SEND ME THE SMELLING SALTS SO I CAN SHOVE THEM UP MY ASS.
FOR GODSAKES THIS IS ELDERLY MORMON HARRY REID'S REACTION.
>> I WAS RAISED IN A LITTLE TOWN THAT HAD 13 BROTHELS IN IT SO I'M USED TO SOME PRETTY SALTY LANGUAGE.
>> Jon: ADMIT IT, WHEN HE STARTED WITH RAISED IN, YOU WERE THINKING DISTRICT MORMON
HOUSEHOLD OR AN ERA THAT WAS MORE CIVIL.
BUT HE WAS WHEN I WAS A KID IT WAS ALL WHOREHOUSES.
IT WAS JUST ASS, ASSASS, YOU FEEL ME, RIGHT?
MAYBE MY FAVORITE TREATMENT IS HOW OUR FRIEND AS THE A CERTAIN MORNING SHOW DEALT WIT.
>> WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MOVE A THIRD BILL WHEN THE SENATE GETS OFF THEIR (bleep) AND DOES SOMETHING.
>> Jon: WHEN YOU BLEEP IT IT SOUNDS TEN TIMES WORSE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE COULD HAVE SAID (bleep).
IF THE HOME AUDIENCE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT WORD I SAID SEND A SELF ADDRESSED ENVELOPE TO BRIAN
