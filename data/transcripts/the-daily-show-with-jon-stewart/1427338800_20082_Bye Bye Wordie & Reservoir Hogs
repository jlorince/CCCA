(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW, MY NAME IS JONSTEWART.
WE HAVE A FABULOUS SHOW THATWE HAVE PUT TOGETHER TONIGHT,
BY HAND, AN ARTISANALSHOW IF YOU WILL.
FILMMAKERS KIRBY DICK ANDAMY ZIERING WILL BE HERE.
BUT FIRST, ACCORDING TOSCIENCE, EARTH JUST
EXPERIENCED ITS WARMESTWINTER SINCE RECORD-KEEPING
BEGAN IN 1880.
WE EXPLORE WHY THAT IS JUST ARANDOM MEANINGLESS FACT IN OUR
NEW SEGMENT La, La, La, La, La,La, La.
I WONDER IF ANTARCTICA ISINCLUDED IN THAT.
OF COURSE, CLIMATE CHANGEWILL AFFECT THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY BUT NO NOWHERE MORESO THAN OUR TWO MOST PHALLIC
STATES, FLORIDA ANDCALIFORNIA.
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARETHINKING.
DOCTORS DO TELL ME,IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL TO HAVE A
NEVADA SHAPED CURVEIN YOUR PENIS.
THE IRONIC THING IS THATCLIMATE CHANGE IS GIVING
EACH OF THESE STATES THEEXACT OPPOSITE PROBLEM.
>> A TEN-FOOT RISE IN SEALEVEL WOULD PUT THE ENTIRE
CITY OF MIAMI BEACH ANDMUCH OF SOUTH FLORIDA
UNDERWATER.
>> THE GOLDEN STATE ISTURNING DEEP RED, 40% OF
CALIFORNIA IS IN EXCEPTIONALDROUGHT.
THE MOST SEVERE CATEGORY.
>> Jon: ONE IS TOO WET, THEOTHER TOO DRY, I THINK THE
ANSWER IS OBVIOUS.
CONDEMN AND DESTROY BOTHSTATES USING EXPLOSIVES.
PUERTO RICO AND GUAM, YOU'REUP.
STILL GOTTA HAVE 50.
HERE'S HOW FLORIDAIS HANDLING ITS CLIMATE
CHANGE ISSUES.
>> ATTORNEYS FOR THE FLORIDADEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION SAID THAT ONCEGOVERNOR RICK SCOTT
TOOK OFFICE BACK IN 2011 THEYWERE TOLD NOT TO USE THE
WORDS CLIMATE CHANGE ORGLOBAL WARMING.
>> WE JUST COULD SAY THEWATER IS GETTING HOTTER.
WE COULDN'T TALKABOUT WHY THE WATER WAS
GETTING HOTTER. AT SOMEPOINT IT WAS MENTIONED THAT
SEA LEVEL RISE WOULD BEREFERRED TO AS NUISANCE
FLOODING.
>> Jon: OH, YES, NUISANCEFLOODING.
MOISTURE INCONVENIENCE,STATEWIDE JACUZZIFICATION.
IT APPEARS BY 2020 MIAMI WILLBE INVOLVED IN A SURPRISE
POOL PARTY.
THESE ARE ALL TERMS, OFCOURSE, IN ROGET'S DENIAL
THESAURUS.
ROGET'S DENIAL THESAURUS,THETHAURUS --
[BLEEP] ROGET'S DENIALTHESAURUS FOR WHEN YOU ARE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH YOUR SONHAVING A BOYFRIEND BUT ARE
FINE WITH A LIVE-IN CROSSFITBUDDY.
OR PLATONIC FELLATIO PARTNER.
JUST DON'T LOOK UP FELLATIO.
NOW GOVERNOR SCOTT CLAIMS THATCONTRARY TO THE ALLEGATIONS
OF FOUR FORMER STATEEMPLOYEES, THERE IS NO RULE
AGAINST SAYING CLIMATECHANGE.
SO PRESUMABLY IF WE WERE TOSAY CHECK IN ON A STATE
SENATE HEARING FROM LASTWEEK, WE WOULD NOT SEE
FLORIDA'S EMERGENCYMANAGEMENT CHIEF TYING
HIMSELF IN KNOTS TO AVOIDVIOLATING THIS NONEXISTENT
UNRULE.
>> ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THENEW PROCEDURES THAT FEMA
ISSUED JUST THIS WEEKDEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE.
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS ATTHIS POINT WE WILL REQUIRE
THAT FUTURE VERSIONS OF OURMILTGATION PLAN WILL BE
REQUIRED TO HAVE LANGUAGEDISCUSSING THAT ISSUE.
>> WHAT ISSUE IS THAT?
>> THE ISSUE THAT YOUMENTIONED EARLIER REGARDING --
>> TOO MUCH.
>> Jon: WAIT, WAIT, DON'TLAUGH, THAT GUY, I THINK
THAT ONE GUY NEEDS THEHEIMLICH.
HE'S OUR FIRST CLIMATECHANGE CASUALTY.
WHY DID I EAT SHRIMP WHILELISTENING TO THE SPEECH?
THE NATION'S MORE WESTERLYPENIS HAS ITS OWN WAY TO
HANDLE CLIMATE EMERGENCIES.
>> THE NEXT MONTH THE HOMESMAY BE LIMITED TO OUTDOOR
WATERING JUST A COUPLE DAYSA WEEK.
RESTAURANTS MIGHT BE BANNEDIF SERVING WATER UNLESS A
CUSTOMER ASKED FOR THE WATER.
>> HOTELS WOULD NEEDPERMISSION FROM GUESTS
BEFORE WASHING THEIR TOWELS.
>> EVEN WORSE, CELEBRITIESWISHING TO RAISE ALS
AWARENESS WILL BE FORCED TOTAKE THE SAND BUCKET
CHALLENGE.
SO CALIFORNIA'S FIX FORTHE BIGGEST DROUGHT IN ITS
HISTORY, IS TO SLIGHTLYCURTAIL THE PETITION ALL
WATER USE THAT MAKES UP AWHOPPING 4% OF CALIFORNIA'S
WATER FOOTPRINT.
WHAT IS THE OTHER MORE THAN90%?
>> ALFALFA IS CALIFORNIA'SLARGEST ACREAGE CROP AND
ALSO ONE OF THE MOST WATERINTENSIVE USE BEING A FIFTH
OF THE STATE'S PRECIOUSWATER.
>> ORCHARD AFTER ORCHARD OFALMOND TREES.
ALMONDS DRAW BIG PROFITS BUTTHEY NEED WATER ALL YEAR LONG.
>> THE "L.A. TIMES" SAYINGTHAT IT USES 660 GALLONS OF
WATER JUST TO MAKE ONEBURGER.
>> Jon: WELL, THAT'S-- BUT ALOT OF THAT IS DUE TO
CALIFORNIA'S OUTDATED LOGFLUME SLAUGHTER HOUSES.
THAT'S -- WALT DISNEY, IT'SBETTER WE HAD A PICTURE OF
THEM DOING THIS, IT WASBETTER.
BUT LOOK, IFGROWING ALMONDS AND THE FOOD
FOR LIVESTOCK IS USING UPALL THEIR WATER, MAYBE WE
NEED TO CUT BACK ON -->> HEY STEWART, YOU CONSERVATION
-LOVING SON A BITCH.
>> Jon: WAIT, WHO, WHO IS THAT?ALMOND!
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: WHAT DO YOU WANT,ALMOND?
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU TO LAYOFF THE WATER RESTRICTIONS
FOR AGRICULTURE, CAPICHE?UNLESS YOU NEVER WANT TO SEE
ME CRUSTED ATOP YOUR FISHAGAIN.
YOU PLAY BALL OR SAY GOOD-BYETO TROUT ME-ONDINE.
>> YOU KNOW ACTUALLY,THE NUT CRUST ON FISH.
NOT MY FAVORITE WAY TO DO IT. ILIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE SPRITZ OF
LEMON, A LITTLE TARTAR, MAYBE ALITTLE BIT OF --
>> OH SHUT UP! HOW ABOUT THIS,YOU NONLACTOSE PROCESSING
BASTARD.
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU KNOWTHAT?
>> YEAH! SAY ADIOS TO MYDELICIOUS ALMOND MILK.
>> Jon: I ACTUALLY DRINK COFFEEBLACK, THAT IS NOT A BIG DEAL
AND BESIDES, NONE OF THIS ISPERSONAL, ALMOND.
I'M JUST -->> HEY, HO, WOAH!

>> Jon: WHAT ARE YOU DOINGHERE, BURGER?
>> THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH, YOUTHINK YOU CAN [BLEEP] WITH A
LITTLE NUT, BUT I GOT TOTELL YOU, I GOT GUYS ON THE
