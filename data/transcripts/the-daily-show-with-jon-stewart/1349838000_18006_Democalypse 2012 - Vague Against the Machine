>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OH, WE GOT A NICE ONE FOR YOU
TONIGHT!
BEN AFFLECK, DIRECTOR, ACTOR,
WRITER BEN AFFLECK WILL BE
JOINING US WITH A GREAT NEW
MOVIE "ARGO."
BUT FIRST.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
(LAUGHTER)
WITH JUST FOUR WEEKS TO GO TO
ELECTION DAY THE INSURMOUNTABLE,
UNBLOWABLE LEAD THE THAT
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA ENJOYED
POST-CONVENTION --
(LAUGHTER)
-- HAS BEEN MOUNTED AND MOAN BY
MITT ROMNEY.
(LAUGHTER)
(LAUGHTER)
NO?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I STAND BY THAT PHRASE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IT IS NOW MITT ROMNEY WHO
CANNOT BE MOUNTED OR BLOWN.
I -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A BETTER
-- WILL THERE'S A BETTER WAY OF
SAYING THIS, I'M SURE.
SO PERHAPS NOW IS THE TIME TO
ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT
OUR FUTURE OVERLORD HAS BEEN
SAYING.
(LAUGHTER)
HIS DREAMS, HIS ASSESSMENT OF
THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY NOW
THAT HE IS 100% ASSURED OF
WINNING THIS ELECTION AS OBAMA
WAS JUST LAST WEEKEND.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.
IT IS NOT WORKING.
TRILLION-DOLLAR DEFICITS FOR THE
LAST FOUR YEARS.
THERE'S OVER $16 TRILLION IN
DEBT.
HARDER AND HARDER FOR SMALL
BUSINESSES TO GROW AND THRIVE.
THE AMOUNT OF DEBT WE'RE ADDING
AT A TRILLION A YEAR IS SIMPLY
NOT MORAL.
>> Jon: NOT MORAL!
(LAUGHTER)
THAT MEANS FOR MITT ROMNEY THIS
TERRIBLE DEBT IS WORSE THAN OF
FEPT.
(LAUGHTER)
>> JON?
>> YES, MORMON GOD.
>> NOT COOL, BRO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SHOULDN'T YOU BE ON
BROADWAY?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> NO, NO!
>> Jon: LITTLE JOKE THERE.
BUT ALL RIGHT WE HAVE BEEN
IRRESPONSIBLE WITH GOVERNMENT
SPENDING.
ROMNEY, BRING THE TOUGH LOVE.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO LOSE?
>> I DON'T WANT ANY CHANGE TO
MEDICARE FOR CURRENT SENIORS OR
FOR THOSE THAT ARE NEARING
RETIREMENT.
NO CHANGE IN SOCIAL SECURITY FOR
THOSE THAT ARE IN RETIREMENT OR
NEAR RETIREMENT.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, SO IT'S
IMMORAL DEBT BUT HANDS OFF THE
CORE ENTITLEMENTS!
THEY'VE LITERALLY BEEN
GRANDFATHERED IN--
GRANDMOTHERED.
(LAUGHTER)
PROBABLY THE MORE PERIPHERAL
ENTITLEMENTS GOT TO GO.
>> I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE WE
HAVE THE KIND OF TRAINING
PROGRAMS THAT GIVE PEOPLE THE
SKILLS THEY NEED FOR THE JOBS OF
TODAY.
>> Jon: OKAY, SO HANDS OFF
CHINESE LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION
PROGRAMS.
(LAUGHTER)
I GUESS THE CUTS ARE GOING TO
COME FROM BIG SPENDING BOON DOOG
STUFF LIKE DEFENSE.
>> I'LL RESTORE OUR NAVY TO THE
SIZE NEEDED TO FULFILL OUR
MISSIONS.
BY BUILDING 15 SHIPS PER YEAR,
INCLUDING THREE SUBMARINES.
>> Jon: IT MAY SOUND FISCALLY
IRRESPONSIBLE --
(LAUGHTER)
-- BUT WITH THREE SUBMARINES
JUST SEVEN MORE AND AMERICA GETS
A FREE SANDWICH!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO BIG DEFENSE PROJECTS -- DID
YOU ENJOY THAT?
BIG DEFENSE PROJECTS AND THE
SOCIALIST PROGRAMS, THOSE WILL
NOT BE TOUCHED.
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S RAISING
TAXES.
>> I'M GOING TO LOWER RATES
ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL
AMERICANS BY 20%.
>> Jon: WHAT?
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!
WE GET TO KEEP ALL OUR STUFF AND
PAY LESS TOO?
THIS IS LIKE THOSE SPECIAL
POTATO CHIPS THAT THEY MADE WITH
OLESTRA THAT HAD ALL THE FLAVOR
--
(LAUGHTER)
BUT NONE OF THE CALORIES AND, OF
COURSE, EVERY NOW AND AGAIN
THERE WAS A HINT -- A SKOSH OF
AGE LEAKAGE BUT IT'S FINE.
(LAUGHTER)
YOU KNOW, YOU'D BE IN A MEETING
AND YOUR ASS WOULD DO A SPIT
TAKE BUT --
(LAUGHTER)
BUT THE POINT IS THIS.
THEY WERE DELICIOUS.
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT RED BLOODED AMERICAN
WOULDN'T TRADE FLAVOR FOR
OCCASIONAL ASS-JUICE?
(LAUGHTER)
THE POINT IS -- BY THE WAY, I AM
JUST GOING TO ASSUME THEY ARE
NOT A SPONSOR.
(LAUGHTER)
I DON
