[ APPLAUSE ]>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
I'M BACK.
I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, FORMERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE, LEON
PANETTA, HE'S GOT A NEW BOOKTHERE CALLED "WORTHY FIGHTS."
SPEAKING OF WHICH, WE BEGINTONIGHT WITH ISIS.
THAT'S THEM.
TERRORIST ARMY RAMPAGING ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST.
AN ORGANIZATION SO VILE, JUST THINKING ABOUT IT IS ENOUGH TO
MAKE YOU VOMIT NON-STOP FOR HOURS ON END.
WHILE SITTING ON THE TOILETDRENCHED IN SWEAT.
I, I, I -- I HAD A BAD DAYYESTERDAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]THE POINT IS THIS: SEAFOOD
NEWBERG IS NOT ALL -- OH NO, I'MSORRY.
THE POINT IS THIS:THIS GROUP IS A GRAVE THREAT
TO ALL THAT CIVILIZATION HOLDSDEAR.
President Obama: THIS GROUP HAS TERRORIZED ALL WHO THEY
COME ACROSS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.
>> IT'S MORE FRIGHTENING THANANYTHING I THINK I'VE SEEN.
>> THEY ARE AN IMMINENT THREAT TO EVERY INTEREST WE HAVE.
President Obama: WE WILL HUNTDOWN TERRORISTS WHO
THREATEN OUR COUNTRYWHEREVER THEY ARE.
>> Jon: WHEREVER!
EVEN UNDER YOUR BED.
LOOK OUT!
WAIT, OH THERE THEY ARE. NEXT TOJASON, I THINK.
OR MAYBE THAT'S THE CHAINSAWMASSACRE GUY.
HERE'S HOW SERIOUS THE THREAT IS. THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY IS COMING TOGETHER TO STOP IT.
>> THE UNITED STATES BOASTS A COALITION OF MORE THAN 40
COUNTRIES AS PART OF THIS ANTI-ISIS EFFORT.
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE BOASTING.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE BOASTING ABOUT THE COALITION.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE BOASTINGABOUT IT.
I MEAN, YEAH, IT'S BIGGER THANTHE AVERAGE COALITION.
[ LAUGHTER ]IF YOU WERE TO MEASURE, IF YOU
WERE TO MEASURE OUR COALITION,WE DON'T -- YOU KNOW.
WE DON'T NEED TO MEASURE.
LET'S JUST SAY I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE
COALITION, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'MSAYING.
[ LAUGHTER ][ APPLAUSE ]
>> SO, TWO WEEKS AFTER THEUNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES
BEGAN AN ALL OUT BOMBINGCAMPAIGN AGAINST THE EVIL THAT
ISIS, LET US SEETHE GLORIOUS RESULTS.
>> ISIS MILITANTS ARE ADVANCINGQUICKLY ON THE CITY OF KOBANI
WHICH IS RIGHT ONTHE TURKISH BORDER.
ISIS HAS ALREADY PREPARED A HUGE FLAG TO FLY OVER KOBANI
ONCE IT CAPTURES THE CITY. [ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEP]. ARETHEY TAKING OVER
THE CITY OR PREPARING IT FOR ARAIN DELAY?
WHAT KIND OF -- ROLLING OUT THEISIS TARP WHENEVER IT RAINS.
WAIT A SECOND, I THOUGHT WE WERETAKING CARE OF THESE GUYS.
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS,WHAT'S GOING ON?
MAYBE THE TERRAIN IS TOO TOUGH, OR ISIL IS MADE OF
SHADOW.
>> THE SYRIAN TOWN OF KOBANIWILL FALL TO THE MILITANTS.
>> THE ISIS FIGHTERS QUITE CASUALLY WALKING UP TO KOBANI.
>> TANKS TOWARDS KOBANI, MOVINGTHROUGH FAIRLY OPEN SPACES.
>> ISIS TANKS, ISIS VEHICLESFREELY ROAMING AROUND THE
COUNTRYSIDE FOR THELAST FIVE DAYS.
>> Jon: ISIL FIGHTERS APPARENTLYSAYING THINGS LIKE YOO WHOO,
TAKING NUMEROUSSUNBATHING BREAKS.
LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED TO THEWHOLE DESTROY AND DEGRADE PLAN?
DON'T YOU GUYS REALIZE IF THEYTAKE OVER KOBANI
OUR ENTIRE YOGURT SUPPLY WILL BEIN JEOPARDY?
HOLD ON -- I'M BEING TOLD THAT'SCHOBANI. KOBANI IS APPARENTLY
A SYRIAN KURDISH TOWN ON THEBORDER OF TURKEY.
AND DOES NOT HAVE REAL BLUEBERRIES MIXED IN IT.
MY POINT IS THIS.
YOU GUYS SAID ISIS IS THE MOST EVIL THING SINCE HITLER'S
SLICED BREAD.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, YOU BROKE INTO DANCING WITH THE STARS TO TELL
US WE'RE HUNTING DOWN MEMBERS AND ASSETS WHEREVER THEY ARE.
WELL, THESE GUYS ARE BURNINGTANK DONUTS ON A KOBANI
HILLTOP, AND THEY ARE ISIS,SO WHAT'S UP?
>> THE CITY OF KOBANI MAY WELLFALL TO ISIS, AND THE
UNITED STATES IS NOTOVERLY CONCERNED.
>> U.S. OFFICIALS SAYING THATIT'S  NOT A TOP PRIORITY.
>> BROADLY FOCUSED, NOT JUST ON ONE CITY AND ONE TOWN.
WE HAVE TO STAY BROADLY FOCUSED ON THE WHOLE REGION.
>> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEUNITED STATES FOR US TO ALSO
STEP BACK AND REMEMBEROUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE.
>> IT'S NOT A KEY CITY STRATEGICALLY.
IT MATTERS BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL GET SLAUGHTERED AND
THAT'S AN AWFUL, AWFUL THING,BUT ISIS COMING TO THE TURKISH
BORDER, IT'S NOT A MAJOR CROSSING.
>> Jon: SO KOBANI SEEMS TO FALLSOMEWHERE BETWEEN A TOWN ABOUT
TO FALL TO THE GREATESTTHREAT WE'VE EVER SEEN,
AND, YOU KNOW, A SLOW DRIPFROM A KITCHEN SINK.
>> FOR MORE WE'VE GOT SENIOR WARCORRESPONDENT JORDAN KLEPPER.
HE IS IN KOBANI TONIGHT.
JORDAN, THANK YOU FORJOINING US.
THE TOWN, JORDAN, THE TOWN MUSTBE NEAR PANIC.
>> NO, THEY TOTALLY GET IT. ASONE BRAVE KOBANI RESIDENT
TOLD ME, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TODO? WE CHOSE TO,
WE CHOSE TO LIVE IN A PLACE OF NO STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE.
OUR BAD.
>> Jon: THAT SOUNDS A LITTLEPASSIVE AGGRESSIVE,
QUITE FRANKLY. >> NOT AT ALL.
THEY'RE COMPLETELY AT PEACE.
SURE, YOU MIGHT THINK, BORDER TOWN RIGHT BETWEEN OUR ALLY
AND OUR ENEMY MIGHT BE WORTHTAKING OUT AN ISIL TANK OR TWO,
BUT YOU'D BE WRONG, JON.
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT IN CHARGEAND YOU DON'T HAVE A WELL
THOUGHT OUT PLAN TO FIGHT ISIL.
>> Jon: WHICH IS WHAT AGAIN?
>> CLASSIFIED.
OR IT'S STILL INDEVELOPMENT. OR --
>> Jon: SO IN KOBANI THEY ACCEPTTHEIR FATE.
>> NOT ONLY THAT, THEY'RE DOINGWHATEVER THEY CAN TO STREAMLINE
THE PROCESS. MARKING THEIR WALLSWITH X'S.
PAINTING TARGETS ON THEIR ROOFS.
PRE-WEAKENING SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS.
>> Jon: WELL, IF THAT'S THECASE, WHY DON'T THEY JUST KNOCK
THE CITY DOWN THEMSELVES.
>> WELL, THEY DON'T WANT TO EMASCULATE ISIL.
THEY WANT TO SET THEM UP TO SUCCEED.
THEY'RE JUST LOOSENING THE LID ON THE PICKLE JAR A LITTLE.
SO WHEN ISIL COMES ALONG, OHLOOK, HONEY, YOU'RE SO STRONG,
YOU DID IT ALL BY YOURSELF.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: SO AT THIS POINT
WHAT'S THEIR ATTITUDE IN KOBANI TOWARDS THE UNITED STATES?
>> OH, THEY (BLEEP) HATE US,JON.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, JORDAN.
JORDAN KLEPPER, EVERYBODY. WE'LLBE RIGHT BACK.
