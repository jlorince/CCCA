>> Jon: WELCOME BACK,
EVERYBODY.
THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF HAND WRINGING ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF
REBUILDING A WAR TORN SOCIETY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY SECOND OFF AN EXTREMIST CONSERVESY OF --
CONSERVECY IN A COUNTRY THAT IS A FEUDAL ECONOMY.
WAAA SPREADING WESTERN CULTURES.
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THE MILITARY HAS ENCAPSULATED THE PROBLEMS IN AFGHANISTAN IN ONE SIMPLE POWER
POINT CHART.
THIS IS THE STRATEGY CHART PRESENTED TO GENERAL STANLEY McKHREUS TAL.
I'M SURPRISED HE IS NOT STATESIDE SIPPING SAN DEGREEA NEXT TO THE MOUNTED HEAD OF
OSAMA BIN LADEN.
LET'S FOLLOW THIS SIMPLE PATH TO VICTORY, SHALL WE?
START THERE AT THE COALITION CAPACITY PRIORITIES THERE.
GO TO THE COALITION OPS ADVISORY AID.
GO TO THE OVERALL GOVERNMENT GASITY AND WORK DOWN -- IT'S THE SELL RIFF MESSAGE QUALITY VERSUS
THER IS RECEIVE DOCTOR PERCEIVED DAMAGE AND TAKE IT TO THE PERCEPTION OF COALITION INTENT
AND COMMITMENT.
OF COURSE, AFTERNOON APPLICATION OF THE GOVERNMENT VERSUS INSURGENCY IS GOING TO MAKE A
DIFFERENCE AND USE OF DAMAGE BY THE INSURGENCY AND THE ABILITY TO RECONCILE, PERCEIVED SECURITY.
EXPECTATIONS AND THEN OF COURSE THE SERVICES FOR THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE -- OBVIOUSLY AN
ISSUE FOR PEOPLE LEGITIMATE OTHER PRODUCTION AND SERVICES NOT -- AS OF COURSE, POPULAR SUPPORT.
THAT'S WHY WE ARE -- OH, NO!
OH, NO!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
MY BAD.
I'M SORRY.
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE TOUCHED THE GRAPH.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT WHEN THE GENERAL SAW THE CHART HE JOKED WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THAT SHROEUD
SHROEUD, -- SLIDE WE'LL HAVE WON THE ARREST WAR.
YES, EITHER THAN OR WE'LL KNOW HOW TO BUILD A THERAMIN.
YOU'LL USE THAT TO WIN OVER THE INSURGENTS.
WRONG CROWD?
NOT A RUSSIAN CONSERVATORY CROWD NOW WE CAN SEE THE USELESS GRAPHIC PRESENTATIONS BUT YOU
CAN'T DENY THE USE BY SOME OF HISTORIES GREATEST WARRIORS.
>> I WANT TO YOU REMEMBER THAT NO BASTARD EVER WON A WAR BY DYING FOR HIS COUNTRY.
HE WON IT MAY MAKING THE OTHER POOR DUMB BASTARD DIE FOR HIS COUNTRY.
>> A SMALL ONE MAN FIGHTER SHOULD BE ABLE TO PENETRATE THE OUTER DEFENSE.
THE EMPIRE DOESN'T CONSIDER A ONE MAN FIGHTER TO BE A THREAT OR THEY WOULD HAVE A TIGHTER DEFENSE.
>> ALL THIS STUFF YOU HEARD ABOUT AMERICA NOT WANTING TO FIGHT, WANTING TO STAY OUT OF
WAR SAY HORSE DUNG.
>> THEY MAY TAKE OUR LIVES BUT THEY'LL NEVER TAKE OUR FREEDOM!||||
