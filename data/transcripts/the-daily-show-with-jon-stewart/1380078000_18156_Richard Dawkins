[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE GOD
DELUSION.
HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED "ANAPPETITE FOR WONDER."
PLEASE WELCOME RICHARD DAWKINS.
SIR --[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
THE BOOK IS CALLED "AN APPETITEFOR WONDER.
AND LOOK AT YOU.
LOOK AT YOU WITH THE MOP TOP ANDTHE -- YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN A
BAND WITH THAT.
>> THAT'S WHAT I CALL THEGRINNING IDIOT PICTURE.
THE BRITISH ONE HAS THE RUPERTBROOKS PICTURE THE SIDEWAYS
POETIC LOOK.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE BOTH OFTHOSE, DO YOU?
FAIR ENOUGH.
THERE'S A LIBERAL PRESBYTERIANPASTOR IN MY AUDIENCE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]WHEN I SAY LIBERAL, HERE IS HOW
LIBERAL HE IS, HE IS JEWISH.
[ LAUGHTER ]FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE, YOU
SEEM TO BE THE AVATAR FOR THEDIVIDING LINE OF THE
INCOMPATIBILITY OF RELIGIOUSBELIEF AND SCIENTIFIC BELIEF.
SOMEHOW YOU HAVE, THROUGH MAYBEYOUR WORDS.
>> I'LL TAKE THAT.
>> Jon: HIS QUESTION WAS:  CAN>>YOU LET RICHARD DAWKINS KNOW
THAT THERE ARE RELIGIOUS
INDIVIDUALS WITH A STRONGBELIEF IN GOD WHO BELIEVEIN THE SCIENTIFIC
METHOD.
DOES THAT SEEM INCONGRUOUSTO YOU?
>> NO, I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: HE SAID ASK HIM IF
HE'S AWARE OF THAT AND I GO, I'MPRETTY SURE HE'S AWARE OF THAT.
>> IT'S A POINT I MAKE.
I OFTEN JOIN FORCES WITH BISHOPSAND OTHER FRIENDS TO COMBAT THE
ANTISCIENTIFIC TENDENCY OFFUNDAMENTALIST RELIGION. IT'S
ONE OF THE GREAT FALLACIES OFFUNDAMENTALISTS THAT THEY THINK
ALL RELIGIOUS PEOPLE ARE LIKETHEM.
>> Jon: HERE IS MY PROPOSALFOR THE DISCUSSION TONIGHT:  DO
YOU BELIEVE THAT THE END OF OURCIVILIZATION WILL BE THROUGH
RELIGIOUS STRIFE OR SCIENTIFICADVANCEMENT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE IN THELONG-TERM BE MORE DAMAGING TO
THE PROSPECTS OF THE HUMAN RACE.
>> THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL MARTINREESE AND PRESIDENT TO THE ROYAL
SOCIETY GIVES HUMANITY A 50%CHANCE OF SURVIVING THROUGH THE
21ST CENTURY.
>> Jon: WAIT, HOLD ON, I HAVETO DO SOME MATH.
OH, FINE.
[LAUGHTER]>> AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS HE
FEARS THAT THE FRUITS OFSCIENTIFIC -- THE BAD FRUITS
THINGS LIKE DIRTY BOMBS, THINGSLIKE BIOLOGICAL WARFARE COULD
GET INTO THE HANDS OFRELIGIOUS
FANATICS WHOUNLIKE ALL OTHER TERRORISTS WANT
TO DIE.
THEY WANT TO GO TO PARADISE.
THE QUESTION YOU ASK THE ANSWERIS BOTH THAT SCIENCE PROVIDES IN
THE FORM OF TECHNOLOGY, WEAPONSWHICH HAVE ONLY BEEN AVAILABLE
TO REASONABLYRESPONSIBLE
GOVERNMENTS WILL LIKELY BECOMEAVAILABLE TO NUTCASES WHO
BELIEVE THAT THEIR GOD REQUIRESTHEM TO WREAK HAVOC AND
DESTRUCTION.
>> Jon: DOESN'T IT THOUGH LETSCIENTISTS OFF THE HOOK TO SOME
EXTENT TO SUGGEST THAT THEIRWORK COULD ONLY BE MISUSED BY
THOSE WHOSE MINDS ARE BOGGLED BYTRELIGIOUS FANATICISM, WHEN INBY
FACT, ISN'T THERE A STRONGPROBABILITY THAT WE ARE NOT
NECESSARILY IN CONTROL OF THEUNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLYMORE LIKELY THAT WE WILL CREATE
SOMETHING THAT THE UNINTENDEDCONSEQUENCE OF IT IS WORLDWIDE
CATASTROPHE?
>> IT'S POSSIBLE.
IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO WORRYABOUT.
THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE, ITHINK IS VERY IMPORTANT.
SCIENCE IS THE MOST POWERFUL WAYTO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.
IF YOU WANT TO DO GOOD IT'S THEMOST POWERFUL WAY OF DOING GOOD
AND IF YOU WANT TO DO EVIL IT'STHE MOST POWERFUL WAY.
>> Jon: I GUESS IT'S THE THIRDLAW FOR EVERY ACTION THERE'S AN
OPPOSITE AND EQUAL REACTION.
YOU SPLIT AN ATOM AND YOU CAN LIGHT
THE WORLD GOING THIS WAY.
AND IF YOU GO THIS WAY YOU CANBLOW UP THE WORLD.
IT SEEMS LIKE WE TRY THIS WAYFIRST.
[LAUGHTER]>> THERE'S A THEORY THAT WHY WE
>DON'T DETECT EXTRA TERRESTRIALCIVILIZATIONS
IT REACHES A POINT WHEN IT'SCAPABILITY OF BROADCASTING RADIO
WAVES WE CAN PICK UP THERE'SONLY A BRIEF WINDOW BEFORE
IT BLOWS ITSELF UP. THERE'S ABRIEF WINDOW BETWEEN DISCOVERING
THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TOCOMMUNICATE BY RADIO AND
PRODUCING THE HORRIFICTECHNOLOGY WHICH THEN GETS OUT
OF CONTROL. IT MAY BE THAT ALLOVER THE UNIVERSE THERE ARE
CIVILIZATIONSWINKING INTO ACTION, BRIEFLY AND
THEN KILLING THEMSELVES.
>> Jon: WHY DO YOU THINK ITONLY TAKES THEM A FEW CENTURIES?
>> THAT'S JUST THE SPECULATION.
>> Jon: YOU FEEL LIKE WE ARELOW ACHIEVING WHEN IT COMES TO
DESTROYING OURSELVES?
>> NOT AT ALL.
IT TAKES MANY BILLIONS OF YEARSFOR EVOLUTION TO REACH THE POINT
WHERE TECHNOLOGY TAKES OFF.
BUT ONCE TECHNOLOGY TAKES OFFBUT THEN IT'S AN EYE BLINK BY
THESTANDARD OF GEOLOGICAL TIME.
ACCORDING TO THIS PESSIMISTICSPECULATION.
ONLY -->> Jon: AT THIS POINT THE ONLY
SPECULATION I HEAR FROM YOU ISPESSIMISTIC.
IT'S EASY TO LOOK AT THE DARKSIDE OF FUNDAMENTALISM AND THE
DAMAGE IT CAN DO.
SOMETIMES I THINK WE HAVE TOCHALLENGE OURSELVES AND LOOK AT
THE DARK SIDE OF ACHIEVEMENT.
I BELIEVE THAT THE FINAL WORDSMAN UTTERS ON THIS EARTH WILL BE
IT WORKED.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT WILL BE AN EXPERIMENT THATISN'T MISUSED BUT WILL BE A
ROLLING CATASTROPHE.
>> IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
>> Jon: A PRETTY GOODPOSSIBILITY.
>> I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUTTHAT.
>> Jon: ABOUT SCIENCE?
>> YES, YES.
>> Jon: IN TERMS OF ITSABILITY TO CONTROL.
CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT AND THECAT NEVER SAW IT COMING.
CAN YOU STICK AROUND?
>> OH, YEAH.
>> Jon: BEAUTIFUL.
"AN APPETITE FOR WONDER" IS ONTHE BOOKSHELVES NOW.
