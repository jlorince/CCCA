[ LAUGHTER ]
AND WON'T FIRE IF YOU ARE CRAZY.
CAN'T THEY DO THAT?
CAN'T THEY INVENT A GUN THAT
DOESN'T FIRE IF YOU ARE CRAZY?
[LAUGHTER]
IT WAS A BIPARTISAN GUN CONTROL
PROPOSAL.
I'M BEING ABOUT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.
THESE TWO SENATORS MANCHIN OF
WEST VIRGINIA, TOOMEY OF
PENNSYLVANIA REPRESENT DIFFERENT
PARTIES AND THEY ARE GOING TO
STAND TOGETHER ON TELEVISION
WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF EACH
OTHER AND YET THEY WILL NOT
FIGHT.
LET'S HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO
SAY.
>> BACK HOME WHERE I COME FROM
WE HAVE COMMON SENSE, NONSENSE
AND NOW WE HAVE GUNSENSE.
>> Jon: INTERESTING HE BRINGS
UP GUNSENSE, I ACTUALLY SAW THAT
OFF BROADWAY IN THE 90s.
AND IT WAS TERRIBLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BUT I'M SORRY I CUT YOU OFF
BEFORE YOU GOT TO THE GOOD PART.
>> WHAT OUR MEASURE WILL DO IT
WILL EXPAND BACKGROUND CHECKS TO
PURCHASES OF FIREARMS AT GUN
SHOWS AND OVER THE INTERNET.
>> Jon: SPEAK OF WHICH, HOLY
(bleep) YOU CAN BUY GUNS OVER
THE INTERNET?
AND WITH NO BACKGROUND CHECK?
SHOULDN'T GUN PURCHASES HAVE AT
LEAST THE SAME PROCEDURAL RIGORS
APPLIED TO PORN SITE SCREENINGS?
