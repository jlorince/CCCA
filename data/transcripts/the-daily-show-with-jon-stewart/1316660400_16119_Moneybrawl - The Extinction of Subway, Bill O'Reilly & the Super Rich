WE'RE 365th IN THE WORLD AT,
OR AS WE LIKE TO THINK OF IT,
THE TOP 10%.
THE PRESIDENT HAS DRAWN STARK POLICY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS OPPONENT.
WE MUST RAISE TAXES ON THE WEALTHY OR RISK THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR 07-YEAR SAFETY SOCIAL NET.
THE REPUBLICANS MUST BE ABLE TO COUNTER THIS BY PUTTING A HUMAN FACE ON THE BURDEN THIS WILL
PLACE ON OUR MOST VULNERABLE WEALTHY.
CUE LOUISIANA GOVERNOR REPUBLICAN AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OF A SMALL BUSINESS
SANDWICH SHOT JOHN FLEMING.
>> THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" ESTIMATED YOUR BUSINESS, A SUBWAY SANDWICH SHOP,
BREAKTHROUGH YOU LAST YEAR OVER $6 MILLION.
>> YEAH, THAT'S BEFORE YOU PLAY 500 EMPLOYEES.
THE AMOUNT I HAVE TO REINVEST IN MY BUSINESS IS $600,000 OF THAT $6.3 MILLION.
BY THE TIME I FEED MY FAMILY, I HAVE MAYBE $400,000 LEFT OVER TO UPGRADE, BUY MORE EQUIPMENT.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Jon: SETTLE DOWN.
LET'S IGNORE FOR A MOMENT THAT THIS GENTLEMAN SEEMS TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLY [BLEEPED] ACCOUNTANT
WHO HAS ADVISED HIM TO PAY PERSONAL INCOME TAX ON MONEY HE REINVESTS IN HIS BUSINESS, BLOW
PAST THE FACT THAT UNDER OBAMA'S PLAN ENSTEAD OF HAVING $400,000
YOU'D HAVE $381,000, LET'S FOCUS ON THE $200,000 YOU SAY A YEAR
YOU NEED TO FAY YOUR FAMILY.
NOW --
[LAUGHTER]
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING YOU MAY NOT KNOW.
THERE IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN BUY A FULL 12 INCHES OF MEAT SUBFOR $5.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
NOW, BY MY CALCULATIONS,
$200,000 WILL BUY YOU 40,000 FEET OF FOOD.
THAT IS EIGHT MILES OF ROOM TEMPERATURE HONEY CURED TECHNICALLY, TURKEY.
PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF THESE PLACES.
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!
SO PROBLEM SOLVED.
>> AGAIN, IF YOU GO AFTER THE HIGHER-INCOME EARNER, YOU'RE ALSO GOING AFTER THE JOB
CREATORS, SO WHATEVER IS CUT OUT OF THOSE EARNINGS IS MONEY TAKEN OUT OF CAPITAL FOR REN
INVESTMENT FOR CREATING MORE JOBS, OPENING UP MORE LOCATIONS.
>> Jon: MORE LOCATIONS AT LONG LAST, SIR?
WE DON'T NEED MORE SUBWAYS.
I'LL SHOW YOU, WE SENT WYATT CENAC TO THE NEAREST SUBWAY.
WYATT, WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?
>> I'M RIGHT HERE, JON.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: BY THE WAY, THE ONLY REASON THEY OPENED A SUBWAY NEXT TO OUR STUDY ROW IS THE ONE
INSIDE OUR STUDIO COULDN'T HANDLE ALL THE BUSINESS.
IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE.
YOU DON'T NORMALLY SEE IT ON CAMERA.
BUT IT SMELLS LIKE A LEFT OF BREAD TOOK A [BLEEPED].
SO THAT'S FINE.
TAXES GO UP.
[LAUGHTER]
TAXES GO UP.
YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF AT TIMES MORE THAN 20 SANDWICH LENGTHS AWAY FROM THE NEXT SUBWAY STORE.
THEY ARE PLENTIFUL.
BUT THERE IS SADLY ONLY ONE PAPA BEAR.
>> IF YOU TAX ACHIEVEMENT, SOME OF THE ACHIEVERS ARE GOING TO PACK IT IN.
AGAIN, LET'S TAKE ME.
MY CORPORATIONS EMPLOY SCORES OF PEOPLE.
THEY DEPEND ON ME TO DO WHAT I DO SO THEY CAN MAKE A NICE SALARY.
IF BARACK OBAMA BEGINS TAXING ME MORE THAN 50%, WHICH IS VERY POSSIBLE, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
LONGER I'M GOING TO DO THIS.
I LIKE MY JOB BUT THERE COMES A POINT WHERE TAXATION BECOMES OPPRESSIVE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: SO IF TAXES ARE RAIDS,
BILL O'REILLY MIGHT QUIT HIS FOX JOB?
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
WELL, THAT, THAT BRINGS US TO OUR NEW SEGMENT, NO, STOP, BILL,
DON'T, PLEASE.
NO.
[LAUGHTER]
I SHOULDN'T POKE FUN.
BILL IS JUST STANDING UP FOR A SHRINKING EXPLOITED MINORITY.
>> RIGHT NOW TAXPAYERS WITH INCOMES ABOVE $1 MILLION REPRESENT JUST .2%, NOT 2%, .2%
OF ALL INCOME TAX RETURNS.
YET THE MILLION DOLLAR BABIES PAY 21% OF ALL THE FEDERAL INCOME TAXES.
>> MILLIONAIRES ARE DISAPPEARING FROM AMERICA.
>> Jon: THE SUPER RICH WILL GO EXTINCT.
WE'D ADD THEM TO THE ENGLAND DANGERRERED SPECIES LIST, BUT YOU NOW HOW MUCH THEY DESPISE
GOVERNMENT REGULATION.
OH, CRUEL IRONY.
PEOPLE, EVERY DAY AMERICA LOSES MORE AND MORE MILLIONAIRES TO ABUSIVE INDIVIDUAL AND CORPED
RAT TAX BREAKS.
THEIR HABITATS ARE SLOWLY DISAPPEARING.
THEIR WATERING HOLES ARE DRYING UP.
IF WE DON'T ACT QUICKLY, THESE ONCE-PLENTIFUL CREATURES WILL BE RELEGATED TO ZOOS AND
HEARTBREAKING DOCUMENTARIES.
HI, I'M JON STEWART.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
WILL YOU BE AN ANGEL FOR A HELPLESS MULTIMILLIONAIRE?
EVERY DAY JAMES MERIWEATHER PHILLIPS, JAMES TO OUR DOMESTIC STAFF, AND THOUSANDS MORE LIKE
HIM LIVE IN FEAR THAT THE TOP MARGINAL TAX RATE WILL BE RAISED FROM ITS CURRENT 35% TO 39.6%.
BUT YOU CAN HELP.
FOR JUST MOST OF WHAT YOU EARN IN A YEAR, YOU CAN HELP JAMES MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE.
CALL NOW BECAUSE HE WANTS THE MONEY NOW.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
