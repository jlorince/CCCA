>> John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER.
JON STEWART STILL NOT HERE IN A
HUGE DEAL.
HE'S ACTUALLY BEING TAKEN OVER
BY AMAZON CEO JEFF BEZOS.
SUCH A SHAME.
JON STEWART PROUDLY OWNED
HIMSELF FOR 50 YEARS.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT FROM THE NEW
FILM "PARANOIA" LIAM HEMSWORTH
IS HERE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
BUT WE START TONIGHT WITH A
SUBJECT EVERYBODY LOVES: TAXES.
WHO IN AMERICA DOESN'T GROW UP
EXCITEDLY LEAVING A BOX OF YOUR
OLD RECEIPTS AT THE FOOT OF YOUR
BED ON APRIL 15 EVE HOPING THAT
IF YOU'VE BEEN GOOD AN
ACCOUNTANT FROM THE NORTH POLE
WILL SHOW UP ON HIS MAGIC SLEIGH
AND REWARD YOU WITH A
SURPRISINGLY LARGE INVOICE FROM
THE GOVERNMENT?
BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT OUR TAX
SYSTEM IS SOMEHOW NOT
UNIVERSALLY BELOVED?
>> WE NEED TO OVERHAUL OUR TAX
CODE.
>> THE TAX CODE IS BROKEN.
IT'S NOT FAIR.
>> IT IS INEFFICIENT.
OUR TAX CODE IS ONE OF THE
WORST IN THE WORLD.
>> SIMPLIFY THE TAX CODE.
WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR TAX
CODE.
>> John: WHOA, WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
YOU CAN'T JUST TALK TO CODES
LIKE THAT.
THEY'RE VERY SENSITIVE.
THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF
CRITICISM THAT DROVE THE MORSE
CODE TO SUICIDE.
FOR ALL OF YOU MORSE CODE FANS.
YES, LOOK, WE ALL THINK THE TAX
CODE NEEDS PRUNING EVERY NOW AND
AGAIN.
THAT IS WHY WE DO IT, I IMAGINE,
EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS.
>> OUR TAX CODE HASN'T BEEN
REFORMED SINCE 1986.
THAT'S 27 YEARS.
>> WOW.
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, THE
TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986 HAPPENED
THE SAME YEAR THAT THIS WAS
HAPPENING.
>> I'M COW BOY GEORGE.
AND I'M BOY GEORGE.
PICK YOUR PICK.
CHOOSE YOUR PICK.
BE THERE, BY GEORGE.
John: WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED
THIS FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC ISSUE
IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY SINCE THE
WAY WHEN BOY GEORGE COULD GUEST
STAR ON THE A-TEAM.
BY THE WAY YOU COULDN'T GET ANY
MORE 1980s THAN THAT IF A
RUBIC'S CUBE MADE LOVE TO A
NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM
AND GAVE BIRTH TO A V.H.S. COPY
OF FLASH DANCE THEN THAT COPY OF
FLASH DANCE WAS RAISED BY THREE
MEN: RIGHT?
WHILE WE HAVEN'T REFORMED THE
TAX CODE SINCE 1986 WE'VE
CERTAINLY ADDED LOTS OF NEW
PROVISIONS AND LOOPHOLES TO IT.
IT'S LIKE IMAGINE YOU HAVE THE
SAME REFRIGERATOR FOR THE LAST
27 YEARS.
YOU HAVEN'T CLEANED IT IN ALL OF
THAT TIME.
BUT YOU KEEP PUTTING FOOD IN
THERE.
AND NOW THE THING SMELLS SO BAD
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO TOUCH IT.
THAT IS AMERICA'S CURRENT TAX
CODE.
AN OLD REFRIGERATOR FULL OF
ROTTEN FOOD.
NOW, OVER THE YEARS,
CORPORATIONS AND OTHER SPECIAL
INTERESTS HAVE MADE A LOT OF
MONEY FROM THIS BROKEN
REFRIGERATOR, EXPLOITING
FEATURES FROM THE INTEREST
DEDUCTION THAT ALLOWS HEDGE FUND
MANAGERS THE PAY ONLY 20% ON
THEIR EARNINGS TO THE DRILLING
COST DEDUCTION THAT LETS OIL
COMPANY WRITE OFF THE EXTRA COST
OF BUSINESS TO THE -- AND THIS
IS TRUE -- CHICKEN POOP CREDIT.
THAT'S REAL.
I'M SERIOUS.
UNDER SECTION 45 OF THE TAX
CODE, YOU CAN GET A TAX BREAK
FOR BURNING CHICKEN POOP.
WHICH IS CLEARLY INSANE.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE PAID TO BURN
CHICKEN POOP.
YOU SHOULD
