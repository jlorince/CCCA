>> Jon: THE NATIONAL-- THE
NATIONAL IMMIGRATION DEBATE
IS MORE CONTENTIOUS THAN
EVER WITH GROWING FEARS OF
THESE ANCHOR BABIES WE
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER, TERROR
BABY, MUPPET BABIES COMING
TO OUR SHORES.
BY THE WAY CHECK OUT THE NEW
MUPPET CHARGE ANCHOR ME
TERROR BABY.
ADOREABLY DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR
COUNTRY.
THE TROUBLE STEMS FROM THE
CONSTITUTION ITSELF,
SPECIFICALLY THE 14th
AMENDMENT'S PROMISE OF BIRTH
RIGHT CITIZENSHIP.
>> THE 14th AMENDMENT
GRANTED CITIZENSHIP TO,
QUOTE, ALL PERSONS BORN OR
NATURALIZED IN THE UNITED
STATES TO PROTECT NEWLY
FREED SLAVES AND THEIR
CHILDREN, AND GUARANTEE
THEIR RIGHTS AS CITIZENS.
LAST TIME I CHECKED, I DON'T
THINK WE'RE HAVING THAT
PROBLEM ANY MORE.
>> I DON'T THINK THE
FOUNDERS UNDERSTOOD WHEN
THEY DID THE 14th AMENDMENT
THAT IT WOULD CREATE A
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE PEOPLE
COULD FLY INTO AMERICA ALL
OVER THE WORLD AND HAVE A
CHILD AND THAT CHILD WOULD
HAVE DUAL CITIZENSHIP.
>> Jon: OKAY, TWO THINGS,
REAL QUICK, A THE FOUNDERS
DIDN'T WRITE THE 14th
AMENDMENT THAT HAPPENED IN
1860.
AND ACTUALLY BEN FRANKLIN
VERY MUCH WANTED TO FLY AND
HAVE BABIES ALL AROUND THE
WORLD THAT IS WHY HE
INVENTED THE SEX KITE.
ANYWAY...
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: DOES THE
CONSTITUTION NEED CHANGING,
FOR ANSWERS WE TURN TO JOHN
HODGMAN AND HIS SEGMENT,
YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> Jon: JOHN HODGMAN JOINS
US, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE
CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS.
>> WELL, THE REALITY THE
CONSTITUTION IS BADLY BROKEN
AND OUT OF DATE.
YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR
NEVER READ IT ANY MORE EVEN
THOUGH IT IS ALMOST
RIDICULOUSLY EASY TO STEAL
FROM THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES.
>> Jon: THAT IS THE ACTUAL
CONSTITUTION.
>> I BELIEVE THIS 5th
AMENDMENT SAYS I DON'T HAVE
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> IN FACT THAT MEANS IT A
GOOD ONE SO WE ARE GOING TO
KEEP IT.
THERE WE GO RZ.
>> Jon: ARE YOU DRAWING ON
IT.
>> YES.
>> Jon: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
GET YOUNG PEOPLE INVOLVED IN
THE CONSTITUTIONS.
>> LET'S START AT THE TOP,
JOHN.
IT'S GOING TO NEED A HIP NEW
NAME.
CONSTITUTION, IT'S VERY
NEGATIVE Y NOT SOMETHING A
LITTLE MORE POSITIVE, WHY
NOT A PRO-STITUTION.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: ACTUALLY THERE IS
ONE REASON I CAN THINK OF
THAT THAT WOULDN'T REALLY BE
A GOOD IDEA.
>> TOO LATE, I'VE ALREADY
MADE THE CHANGE.
WHICH BRINGS ME TO SOLUTION
NUMBER TWO, LET'S TRIM THE
FAT.
I MEAN BASICALLY EVERYTHING
AFTER AMENDMENT 10 WASN'T
WRITTEN BY THE FOUNDERS, SO
THAT CAN GO.
AND SOME CONSTITUTIONAL
SCHOLARS THINK WE CAN GO
FURTHER THAN THAT.
>> CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH SO
MANY OTHER STATES DEFINING
TRADITIONALLY WHAT MARRIAGE
IS.
AND TO SEE THAT THIRD BRANCH
OF GOVERNMENT UNDOING THE
WILL OF THE PEOPLE, IT'S
FRUSTRATING.
>> Jon: THE FOUNDERS
ESTABLISHED JUDICIARY, NOW
JUST TO ABOLISH IT BECAUSE
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH IT,
THAT SEEMS WHAT --
>> A FEW MALL OT WOUNDING
BRAIN BALL BULLIED LAWYERS
OVERRULING THE WILL OF THE
PEOPLE, IT'S UNDEMOCRATIC.
AND MY THIRD SOLUTION, LET'S
GET THE PRO-STITUTION BACK
TO THE PEOPLE BY PUTTING IT
ON THE INTERNET.
I GIVE YOU THE WIKI
WIKI-PRO-STITUTION.
AN OPEN SOURCE DOCUMENT A
MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS WHERE
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE CAN
FINALLY SPEAK.
IT ALREADY HAS 6,000 NEW
AMENDMENTS, AND AS YOU CAN
SEE THE PEOPLE AND THEIR
WISDOM HAVE OUTLAWED ANCHOR
BABIES, LEGALIZED MARIJUANA,
AND APPARENTLY WE HAVE
BANNED WEREWOLVES.
THAT MAKES SENSE, TEAM
EDWARD IS VERY ACTIVE ON THE
WIKI-PRO-STITUTION.
>> Jon: THAT'S A FASCINATING
DOCUMENT, I'M SURE WE WILL
STAND THE TEST OF TIME BUT
IT'S HARD TO TAKE ARGUMENTS
FOR CHANGING THE
CONSTITUTION SERIOUSLY WHEN
SOME OF THOSE SAME PEOPLE WE
ARE SHOWING NORMALLY SAY THE
CONSTITUTION IS SACROSANCT.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T
THINK THEY HAVE TO ENFORCE
THE CONSTITUTION AS IT IS
WRITTEN.
THEY WOULD LIKE TO ENFORCE
IT AS THEY WOULD LIKE IT TO
HAVE BEEN WRITTEN.
>> I AM SO SICK OF PEOPLE
TAKING THIS CONSTITUTION
WE'RE RUNNING IT THROUGH THE
SHREDDER, EVERY TIME
SOMEBODY WANTS TO DO WHAT
THEY WANT TO DO.
>> WE TOOK THESE GUYS A LONG
TIME, THEY READ A LOT OF
BOOKS AND A LOT OF HISTORY
TO PUT THE PRINCIPLESS
TOGETHER IN THIS THING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> WAIT A MINUTE, JON, THAT
IS GLEN BECK'S DEFENSE OF
THE CONSTITUTION T TOOK A
LONG TIME TO WRITE.
IF THAT'S THE CRITERIA THAN
THAT SCREENPLAY ABOUT THE
NOID THAT YOU STARTED BACK
IN THE LATE '80s WILL BE THE
GREATEST DOCUMENT OF ALL
TIME.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: BELIEVE ME, THAT
WILL BE A GREAT FILM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> ANYWAY YOU DIDN'T PLAY
SENATOR SESSIONS ENTIRE
SOUND BITE.
>> I BELIEVE THE SECOND
AMENDMENT IS A VITAL
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T THINK
THEY HAVE TO ENFORCE THE
CONSTITUTION AS IT IS
WRITTEN.
>> PLEASE, JON, HE WAS ONLY
TALKING ABOUT THE SECOND
AMENDMENT, GUNS, JON.
OF COURSE WE CAN'T CHANGE
THAT CLAUSE.
LOOK THE FOUNDERS MADE IT
SHARPIES PROOF, I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING TO IT.
THEIR ORIGINAL INTENT IS
CLEAR.
THAT'S DZ.
>> Jon: THAT'S THE THINK
THEY TALK ABOUT THE
SACROSANCT PART OF THE
CONSTITUTION WHEN THEY LIKE
IT, AND SUDDENLY THEY SAY
THAT IS NOT WHAT THE
FOUNDERS MEANT.
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
THEY WANT TO PICK AND CHOOSE
THE PARTS OF THE TUTION THEY
WANT.
THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH
THIS ORIGINAL INTENT
BUSINESS.
WE HAVE THE FOUNDERS WORDS
BUT NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT
THEY WERE THINKING AND THEY
ARE NOT-- TO BEGIN WITH.
>> NO ONE, JON, OR NO ONE
MINUS ONE.
I SHOULD TELL YOU I AM A
NOTED FOUNDING FATHER
PSYCHOLOGIST AS YOU WOULD
KNOW IF YOU ARE READ MY BOOK,
MEN ARE FROM MARS, JAMES
MADISON WAS A GOD-LIKE
GENIUS WHO COULD DO NO WRONG
AND I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO
KNOWS WHAT HE IS THINKING.
>> Jon: HOW COULD YOU KNOW
WHAT JAMES MADISON WAS
ACTUALLY THINKING.
>> DIDN'T YOU EVEN LOOK AT
THE COVER OF MY BOOK, JON.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT I DID.
>> I GOT IT STRAIGHT FROM
JAMES MADISON'S SKULL.
JON, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT
THAT A POWDERED WIG-WEARING
SKULL DOESN'T PROVIDE THE
GUIDANCE WE NEED, WHAT THEN?
>> THAT'S A RIDICULOUS
PREMISE, JON, BUT I WILL
PLAY ALONG.
AFTER ALL EVEN JAMES MADISON
RECOGNIZED A HIGHER
AUTHORITY AT WORK.
>> GO BACK TO WHAT OUR
FOUNDERS AND OUR FOUNDING
DOCUMENTS MEANT, THEY'RE
QUITE CLEAR, THAT WE WOULD
CREATE LAW BASED ON THE GOD,
THE BIBLE, THE 10
COMMANDMENTS.
>> Jon: THAT'S WHAT I AM
TALKING ABOUT, THE
CONSTITUTION AND THE BIBLE
IT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THE
CONSTITUTION IS AN AMENDMENT
TO THE BIBLE.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK
THAT IS TRUE BUT THAT IS AN
EASILY FIXED MISCONCEPTION.
IF YOU SDROL SKROL DOWN TO
NEW AMENDMENT 6,666 I THINK
WILL YOU SEE THAT THE BIBLE
IS NOW ACTUALLY A
PRO-STITUTIONAL AMENDMENT SO
IT'S ALL IN THERE.
>> Jon: AND WHAT ABOUT
SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND
STATE WHICH IS IN THE
CONSTITUTION.
>> WHAT'S THAT,
MR. PRESIDENT.
>> Jon: IN THE ORIGINAL.
>> EXCUSE ME, OH, JAMES
MADISON SAID THE SEPARATION
OF CHURCH AND STATE WAS JUST
THEIR LITTLE JOKE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THANK YOU
