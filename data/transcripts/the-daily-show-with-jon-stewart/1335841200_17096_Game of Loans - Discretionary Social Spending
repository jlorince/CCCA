THIS IS GOOD.
BUT THIS IS GOOD.
THIS IS GOOD THAT WE NOW KNOW THE PARAMETERS OF THE CONVERSATION THAT OUR COUNTRY
NEEDS TO START HAVING.
EVERYONE IS SAYING IF WE WANT GOVERNMENT TO HELP PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.
EVERYONE IS AGREEING ON THAT.
DEMOCRATS THINK CLOSING LOOPHOLES AND RAISING MAFER GINAL TAX RATES ON THE WEALTHY
COULD DISCOVER ANY INCREASES IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT ANY INCREASE SHOULD COME AT THE COST OF OTHER DISCRETIONARY
SOCIAL SPENDING.
IT'S AN INTERESTING FUNDAMENTAL DEBATE, ONE THAT WE WOULD BE WELL SERVED TO HAVE.
NOW IF YOU WILL, LET'S WATCH THE DEBATE WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING.
>> THEY COME UP WITH A PAY FOR IT THAT IS A DISGRACEFUL,
GROTESQUE PAY-FOR THAT GOES AFTER WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE NAME OF PROTECTING STUDENT LOANS.
>> YOU'RE YELLING FIRE.
THERE'S NO FIRE.
>> BUT THEY REALLY SEE NOW IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK WOMEN'S HEALTH.
>> ACCUSE US OF WANTING TO GUT WOMEN'S HEALTH IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.
>> THERE WAS A LEVEL OF HYPOCRISY ON THIS FLOOR THAT IS STAGGERING.
>> IT MAKES ME SO ANGRY.
I'M SO ANGRY, I COULD SPIT.
>> Jon: AND THE PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH HIM SAY, YOU ARE ACTUALLY.
WATCHING THIS DEBATE I THINK SPIT WOULD BE THE MOST SUBSTANTIVE THING TO COME OUT OF THIS DEBATE.
IT WAS LAME BUT THERE WAS ONE KIND OF GREAT MOMENT.
WHEN A CONGRESSMAN FROM MINNESOTA WAS SO VEHEMENTLY DEFENDING THE REPUBLICANS'
EXCELLENT TREATMENT OF WOMEN BY... WATCH.
>> WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS USING A SLUSH FUND THAT IS PROVIDED TO THE SECRETARY TO
SPEND AS SHE SEES FIT.
THAT IS PERCEIVED AS AN ATTACK SOMEHOW ON WOMEN.
WHAT A SURPRISE.
IN THIS ELECTION YEAR.
ANOTHER 30 SECONDS PLEASE.
THERE ARE ADEQUATE... THERE ARE MULTIPLE....
>> Jon: WE HAVE A GREAT RECORD ON WOMEN.
I NEED 30 MORE SECONDS.
SHUT YOUR (BEEP) TRAP.
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP GOING.
