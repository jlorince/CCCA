WE TURN NOW TO THE MIDDLE EAST,
THE WORLD'S TOP REGIONAL
EXPORTER OF DEPRESSING NEWS
STORIES.
IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS IT
SEEMED THAT THAT WAS ABOUT TO
CHANGE.
>> ANOTHER FRESH START FOR
MIDDLE EAST PEACE TALKS.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A YEAR AND
A HALF ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS
RESUMING DIRECT PEACE
NEGOTIATIONS.
THERE'S RENEWED HOPE AND
OPTIMISM.
>> Jon: RENEWED HOPE AND
OPTIMISM.
PEACE IN THE HOLY LAND.
HASEL TOF.
-- MAZEL TA *EUS -- TOV.
HIT IT!
SO EXCITING.
IT'S LIKE A BAR MITZVAH, SO SO MUCH
POSSIBLE AND THEN THE
PROFESSIONAL DANCERS HELP THE
YOUNG 13-YEAR-OLD MEET GIRLS.
THAT'S EXCITING.
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD BLOW
THIS NEW FOUND HOPE IS IF ISRAEL
DOESN'T EXTEND THE FREEZE --
>> ISRAEL HAS REASSUMED
SETTLEMENT CONSTRUCTION IN THE
WEST BANK.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: HIT IT.
THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT.
IT'S SAD BUT I'M LOOKING FOR
SADDER JEWISH MUSIC IF I COULD.
♪ LF ON THE ROCKS ♪
♪ LOVE ON THE ROCKS ♪
♪ ♪
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: NEIL DIAMOND.
HE'S LIKE HE'S SINGING TO ME.
HOPE SURVIVED IN THE MIDDLE EAST
FOR THREE WEEKS.
IT WOULD BE SAD EXCEPT THAT'S
THE LONGEST HOPE HAS EVER
SURVIVED IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
THERE'S PLANS FOR A NEW JEWISH
HOLIDAY HOPE-ACOST.
THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS HOPE FOR
THREE DAYS BUT THE HOPE LASTED
SEVEN TIMES THAT LONG BEFORE
RUNNING OUT.
THAT'S WHY FOR THREE WEEKS EVERY
FALL NO JEW EATS VIDALIA ONIONS.
A DEVASTATING THREAT TO A
PROMISING PEACE PROCESS.
THEY HAVE TO BE WALKING ON EGG
SHELLS.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD.
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 2,000 HOMES
READY TO BE BUILT, THE ISRAELIS
RESTRAINED THEMSELVES TO ONLY
BUILDING 26 NEW HOMES WONDERFUL
THAT BE ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE
PALESTINIANS FROM WALKING AWAY
FROM THE NEGOTIATION TABLE.
>> WE HEARD FROM THE PALESTINIAN
PRESIDENT MAHMOUD ABBAS AND HE
SAID NEXT WEEK HE WILL FIND OUT
WHAT THE ARAB COUNTRIES THINK HE
SHOULD DO.
>> Jon: THE ARAB LEAGUE.
THAT'S A TOUGH LEAGUE.
SAUDI ARABIA DOING WELL.
LEBANON HOPING FOR A WILDCARD
SPOT.
FOR GOD SAKES, THE METS RE
BOTTOM OF ARAB LEAGUE AS WELL?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THAT CAN'T BE!
IT'S JUST EMBARRASSING.
THE METS CAN'T EVEN DO WELL IN
THE ARAB LEAGUE.
THOSE COUNTRIES DON'T EVEN PLAY
BASEBALL.
[LAUGHTER]
FOR MORE ON THE RENEWED
CONSTRUCTION WE GO TO "THE DAILY
SHOW" SENIOR MIDDLE EAST
CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER.
JOHN OLIVER JOINS US LIVE FROM
THE WEST BANK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
JOHN, DO YOU -- DO YOU SEE ANY
HOPE FOR A SOLUTION HERE?
>> JON, I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS.
THE COURT HAS TEMPORARILY
EXTENDED THE MORATORIUM ON
BUILDING.
CLEARLY WE JUST NEED TO INVENT
MORE JEWISH HOLIDAYS.
>> Jon: THEY ARE BASED ON
THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF TRADITION.
YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE UP NEW ONES.
>> REALLY?
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> WATCH ME.
BAGEL MANIA.
THREE DAYS AT THE END OF
SEPTEMBER.
FRAN DRESHER'S BIRTHDAY.
THAT'S A BIG ONE, SEPTEMBER 30
AND THE ENTIRE MONTH MANY OF
OCCTOBER.
THREE STRIKES OFF THE TOP OF MY
HEAD.
>> Jon: NOBODY IS -- OKAY.
IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT SOME JEWS
OBJECT TO YOU CHANGING THEIR
CALENDAR.
>> NO PROBLEM, JON.
SINCE THE ISRAELISEN
PALESTINIANS ARE HAVING TROUBLE
DIVIDING THE LAND WHAT IF THEY
BOTH HAVE IT BUT AT DIFFERENT
TIMES OF THE YEAR.
50% OF THE TIME FOR ONE, 50% FOR
THE OTHER, 100% PERFECT
SOLUTION.
>> Jon: THAT'S -- THAT'S --
THAT WOULD END UP CAUSING
PROBLEMS.
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD
SATISFY --
>> IT'S FLEXIBLE.
THEY CAN SWAP OUT VACATION WEEKS
IF WORK SCHEDULES CHANGE.
IT'S EASY.
>> Jon: YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE
A TIMESHARE.
>> YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A
TIMESHARE.
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FRACTIONAL
OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY THAT THE
MIDDLE EAST HAS BEEN WAITING
FOR.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOU ARE -- YOU ARE
CENTURY 21 GUY NOW.
IS THAT IT?
>> CENTURY 21, NOW CENTURY 58.
THINK ABOUT IT.
WHY WOULD EITHER SIDE ATTACK THE
OTHER'S HOUSE IF THEY KNEW THEY
WERE GOING TO BE LIVING IN IT A
FEW MONTH'S TIME?
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
>> Jon: DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
WHATSOEVER, JOHN.
>> WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO PUT
YOU IN A DISPUTED TERRITORY
TODAY?
>> Jon: I HAVE A HOUSE, JON.
>> YOU HAVE A HOUSE IN JERSEY.
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT FAIR.
>> THERE'S A CHANCE NOAH IS BURR
TKPWHREUD YOUR BACKYARD?
>> Jon: BON JOVI'S BATTING
SKAEUG A TWO MINUTE DRIVE.
>> THEY WANT TO YOU HAVE THIS
UNIT.
THIS IS THE PROMISE CONDO.
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT
YOU DOWN FOR THREE UNITS, OKAY.
>> Jon: I DON'T WANT THREE
UNITS.
>> YOU ARE KILLING ME STEWART.
I HAVEN'T RUNNING THE BELL ALL
WEEK.
I HAVE KIDS TO FEED.
>> Jon: YOU DON'T HAVE KIDS.
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO DANCE FOR
YOU?  I'LL DANCE, JON.
IT'S A VERY NICE AREA, VERY NICE
AREA.
WHY DON'T YOU COME LIVE HERE,
HEY!
>> Jon: HAVE SOME DIGNITY.
>> GET READY TO RING THAT BELL,
MURRAY, I'M BRINGING ONE IN.
