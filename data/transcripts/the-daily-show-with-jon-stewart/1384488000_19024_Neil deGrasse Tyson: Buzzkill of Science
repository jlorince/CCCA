ASTROPHYSICIST NEIL DEGRASSETYSON
WHO USES SCIENCE TO CORRECTSOME OF HUMANITIES GREATEST
MISUNDERSTANDINGS.
>> THE FILM "GRAVITY" IS OFFTO AN ASTRONOMICAL START.
>> NEIL DEGRASSE TYSONDIRECTOR OF NEW YORK'S
HAYDEN PLANETARIUMCRITICIZED THE MOVIE AS

>> Jon: TONIGHT ON NEILDEGRASSE TYSON BUZZKILL OF
SCIENCE, ZOMBIES!
WALKING DEAD IS A RUNAWAYTELEVISION HIT, THE ZOMBIE
APOCALYPSE IS CLEARLY ONEVERYONE'S MIND.
ZOMBIES, COULD IT HAPPEN,LET THE DEBUNKING BEGIN.
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT REALLYWHAT I DO.
WHAT I DO, INSTEAD, ISCORRECT ERRORS IN OTHERWISE
SEEMINGLY ACCURATEPORTRAYALS OF SCIENCE.
ZOMBIES ARE NOTHING MORETHAN A FANTASY THAT
WILLFULLY IGNORES LAWS OFPHYSICS AND PHYSIOLOGY LIKE
BACKYARDS TIME TRAVEL ORLOVE.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHEN YOU ARE WATCHING THEWALKING DEAD, THESE ZOMBIE
MOVIES YOU'RE NOT MENTALLYCATALOGING ALL THE THINGS
SCIENTIFICALLY THATTHEY ARE GETTING WRONG.
>> FIRST, JON, I DON'TREALLY WATCH TELEVISION.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
>> WHAT I DO, THIS IS WHAT IDO-- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH EXCITEMENT THERE ISIN A SINGLE DROP OF WATER?
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: NO.
>> IT'S A UNIVERSE OFMICROBES.
>> Jon: OKAY.
HEY, SO IS IT TRUE THAT THEONLY WAY TO KILL A ZOMBIE IS
TO SHOOT IT IN THE HEAD?
>> JON, PLEASE, YOU CANNOTKILL SOMETHING THAT IS
ALREADY DEAD.
WITHOUT A FUNCTIONINGCIRCULATORY SYSTEM
DISTRIBUTING OXYGENATEDBLOOD, A ZOMBIE'S MUSCLES
WOULD SUCCOMB TO RIGORMORTIS.
THEY COULDN'T EVEN STAND LETALONE WALK.
THEY HAVE NO DESIRE TO EATBRAINS BECAUSE THE FATTY
TISSUE WOULD HAVE STOPPEDPRODUCING THE HORMONE
LEPTIN WHICH TRIGGERS THESENSATION OF HUNGER IN THE
FIRST PLACE.
JUST SAYING.
(APPLAUSE)>> Jon: SO IF I GET BIT BY A
ZOMBIE DO I TURN INTO AZOMBIE.
>> OF COURSE NOT.
ZOMBIEISM CAN'T SPREADTHROUGH MASTICATION.
>> Jon: THAT IS HOW THEYSPREAD IT?
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY HAD TOBITE YOU.
>> NO, BEING CHEWED ON BY AZOMBIE.
>> Jon: GOOD, BECAUSE THEYSPREAD IT THE OTHER WAY, I
MEAN-- WE REALLY WOULD BE INTHE MIDDLE OF A ZOMBIE
APOCALYPSE RIGHT NOW.
AND QUITE FRANKLY, I WOULDBE THE LEADER.
>> ZOMBIES ARE A GOODANALOGY FOR VIRAL
OUTBREAKS BUT WHENSOMETHING BITES YOU, YOU
DON'T TURN INTO THAT THING.
AND EVEN IF THAT WASREMOTABLY POSSIBLE, THEN
EVANDER HOLYFIELD WOULD HAVETURNED INTO MIKE TYSON YEARS
AGO.
>> Jon: YOU'RE SAYING NO WAY,NO WAY ZOMBIES EXIST.
>> JON, LET'S NOT GO THATFAR, OKAY. I'M A SCIENTIST.
I HAVE TO BE OPEN TO EVERYPOSSIBILITY.
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING HUMANEARTHLING ZOMBIES BUT I
CAN'T SAY SOMEWHERE IN THEINFINITE REACHES OF THE COSMOS
THERE ISN'TA HEAVENLY PLANET THAT
EVOLVED A LIFE FORMCAPABLE OF REANIMATING AND
FEEDING UPON THE ORGANSOF THE LIVING.
>> Jon: HOLY [BLEEP] I KNOWWHAT IS HAPPENING HERE.
>> SPACE ZOMBIES.
>> Jon: SPACE ZOMBIES, IKNEW IT!
YOU ARE AFRAID OF SPACEZOMBIES.
>> NO, NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.
I'M AFRAID OF REAL THINGS.
>> Jon: REAL THINGS?
LIKE-- LIKE HOW TRILLIONS OFYEARS FROM NOW THE
IRREVERSIBLE INCREASE IN ENTROPYAND OUR ASYMPTOTIC DESCENT
ABSOLUTE ZERO WILL LEAVE THEUNIVERSE AS NOTHING MORE
THAN A COLD, INERT WASTELAND, DEVOID OF LIFE,
MOVEMENT, AND EVEN THE VERYCONCEPT OF ENERGY.
>> Jon: YOU'RE FREAKINGEVERYBODY OUT.
YOU KNOW I CAN JUST TURN THELIGHTS BACK ON, BRING THEM
BACK UP.
BRING THEM BACK UP, SO YOUHAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT
BUT NOT MAKE THE GLOBE INYOUR OPENING CREDITS TURN
THE RIGHT WAY?
MOTHER [BLEEP] TYSON!
