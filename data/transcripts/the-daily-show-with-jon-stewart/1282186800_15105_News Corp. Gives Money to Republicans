LET ME START WITH THIS:  WE ALL
KNOW DEEP DOWN INSIDE IN OUR
HEARTS, IN OUR STOMACHS, IN OUR
MIND THAT MONEY IS CORRUPTING
OUR POLITICAL PROCESS, A FEST
FESTERING SORE ON THE BODY OF
POLITICS.
BUT IT'S COMPLICATED.
LUCKILY THERE'S ONE ORGANIZATION
EXPOSING THIS.
>> BUYING POLITICAL POWER THAT
IS THE SUBJECT OF THE TALKING
POINTS MEMO.
>> LOOK AT THE PLAYERS.
I WANT YOU TO FOLLOW THE MONEY
HERE.
>> THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS BEING
BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY LEFT WING
INTERNET EXTREMISTS.
>> WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THOSE
PEOPLE.
WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW WHERE THEY
GET THEIR CAMPAIGN MONEY.

A LOT TO DO.
LET'S GO.

THEIR NAME IS FOX NEWS AND THEY
WILL NOT STOP UNTIL THEY'VE
IDENTIFIED CORRUPTION PATIENT

JOYCE FOUNDATION GIVES MONEY TO.
THEY GIVE MONEY TO THE TIDES
FOUNDATION.
>> HERE IS A CHART, STAY WITH ME
ON THIS.

WHERE VAN JONES IS STAYING.
THE LARGEST CHUNK OF THEIR MONEY
GOING TO BARACK OBAMA.
IT'S ACORN SPENDING YOUR TAX
DOLLARS.
