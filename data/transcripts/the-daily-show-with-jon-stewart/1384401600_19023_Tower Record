CASSEROLE.

ALL THINGS HOLY YOU POUREDUNCOOKED
MARINARA SAUCE ATOP THECHEESE, ATOP, THE CHEESE, ON
TOP, THE SAUCE, NAKED, ONDISPLAY LIKE SOME SORT OF
SAUCE WHORE.
YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSIONTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS
BAD SEX OR BAD PIZZA.
YOUR PIZZA IS LIKE SEX WITHA CORPSE MADE OF SAND PAPER.
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHINGTHIS IS NOT PIZZA!
THIS IS TOMATO SOUP IN ABREAD BOWL.

REALIZE IT'S VERY COLD INCHICAGO, VERY COLD.
IT'S WINDY, YOU NEED TO BEABLE TO I DON'T KNOW, HAVE A

WARM.
SERIOUSLY, WHO ARE YOUKIDDING?
WHO USES AN IRON SKILLET TOMAKE A PIZZA?
YOU DON'T USE AN IRON SKILLETTO MAKE A PIZZA.
YOU USE IT TO FEND OFFSOMEONE WHO TRIES TO SERVE

HERE'S HOW I KNOW I'M RIGHT.
YOU CALL IT CHICAGO STYLEPIZZA.
YOU CALL IT DEEP DISH PIZZA,STUFFED PIZZA.
