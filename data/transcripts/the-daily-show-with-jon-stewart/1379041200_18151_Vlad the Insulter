(LAUGHTER)I'LL TELL YOU, HOWEVER IT
CAME ABOUT, IT SEEMSVLADIMIR PUTIN SAVED THE
DAY HERE A LITTLE BIT.
AS LONG AS HE DOESN'TARROGANTLY AND PUBLICALLY SHOVE
THAT IN OURFACES I THINK THIS FRAGILE
NEW ARRANGEMENT COULD WORK.
>> THIS MORNING RUSSIANPRESIDENT PUTIN IS
CRITICIZING U.S. POLICY INAN OP ED IN "THE NEW YORK
TIMES".
SAYING U.S. MILITARY ACTIONIN SYRIA WOULD HURT
CIVILIANS AND SPREADCONFLICT.
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, "NEWYORK TIMES", THAT'S HOW YOU
REACH OUT TO AMERICANS?
(LAUGHTER)YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH
BUZZFEED OR-- MAYBE, I DON'TKNOW-- DUCK DYNASTY. I
DON'T KNOW, RIGHT THERESECOND OF ALL WHY ARE YOU
[BLEEP] ON US IN "THE NEWYORK TIMES".
JUST MOMENTS AFTER WESALUTED YOUR STATESMANSHIP?
YOU HAD TO SAY ONE MORETHING.
YOU'RE LIKE THE LARRY DAVIDOF INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY.
(LAUGHTER)BUT LOOK, REASONABLE PEOPLE
CAN DISAGREE ON SYRIA.
VLADIMIR PUTIN IS ENTITLEDTO HIS OPINION ON OUR
POLITICAL STRATEGY.
>> BUT NOW PUTIN IS TAKINGAIM AT OBAMA'S CLAIMS THAT
AMERICA IS AN EXCEPTIONALNATION.
>> Jon: OH NO YOU DID NOT.
(LAUGHTER)WHAT PART OF BUTTER ELVIS
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
(LAUGHTER)>> STATING IT IS EXTREMELY
DANGEROUS TO ENCOURAGEPEOPLE TO SEE THEMSELVES AS
EXCEPTIONAL, WHATEVER THEMOTIVATION.
WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT, BUTWHEN WE ASK FOR THE LORD'S
BLESSINGS, WE MUST NOTFORGET THAT GOD CREATED US
EQUAL.
>> Jon: [BLEEP] IS THAT?
WHEN DID VLADIMIR PUTINSTART WATCHING OPRAH?
WHAT THE HELL?
AND BY THE WAY, VLADIMIR, IDON'T THINK YOU'RE THE BEST
GUY TO PLAY THE EQUALITYCARD.
WE ARE ALL TOGETHER,BEAUTIFUL COLORS IN A
RAINBOW, AS LONG AS YOUDON'T WAVE THAT RAINBOW AS A
FLAG.
THIS IS IT.
YOU WANT US TO GO ROCKY IVON YOUR ASS?
BECAUSE YEAH, OKAY, YOUMIGHT HAVE THE SUPERIOR
TRAINING, FACILITIES.
YOU MIGHT HAVE THE SUPERIORBODY TYPES BUT YOU PICKED A
FIGHT IN "THE NEW YORKTIMES" OP ED PAGE.
SO GUESS WHO YOU'RE STEPPINGIN THE RING WITH.
GET READY FOR THEEXPOUNDABLES, YEAH, THAT'S
RIGHT.
YOU MAY TAKE DOWN KRUGMANBUT DOWD WILL BE RIGHT
BEHIND HIM WITH A CUTTING ANDUNFAVORABLE COMPARISON WITH
YOU AN LET'S SAY McDREAMYFROM GRAY'S ANATOMY.
SHE GOES DOWN YOU STILL HAVETO CONTEND WITH KRISTOF,
FREIDMAN OR DOUTHAT,DOD-- BROOKS, BROOKS-- WE'LL
BE RIGHT BACK.
