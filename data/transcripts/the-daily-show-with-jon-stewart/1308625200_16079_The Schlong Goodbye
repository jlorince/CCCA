MOVING ON.
YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S JUST
GIVE IT BACK TO THE REAL
NEWS SINCE THAT'S WHAT WE DO
HERE.
ANTHONY WEINER STEPPED DOWN
LAST THURSDAY LEAVING MOST
OBSERVERS WONDERING WHAT ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH OUR
GIANT DILDO WHEEL.
(LAUGHTER)
WHOSE'S GOING TO BUY IT NOW?
OF COURSE, WE AT THE DAILY
SHOW ARE NOT AROUND TO COVER
THE NEWS CONFERENCE.
BUT LUCKILY THE 24 HOURS
STEP INTO THE BREACH
WHENEVER THE DAILY SHOW IS
ON ASSIGNMENT, I HAPPENED TO
BE IN A HOTEL ROOM IN D.C.
AT THE TIME SO OBVIOUSLY I
WAS READING THE BIBLE WHILE
HI CNN ON ON THE BACKGROUND.
THEIR ANTICIPATION WAS
PALPABLE.
>> WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HEAR
FROM NANCY PELOSI IN JUST
ABOUT TEN MINUTES.
>> WHEN YOU SEE LEADER
PELOSI IN A MOMENT.
>> I CAN SEE KATE BALDWIN
THERE AT THE NEWS CONFERENCE
GETTING READY, I UNDERSTAND
THAT NANCY PELOSI IS IN THE
ROOM.
>> Jon: I WONDER IF SHE'S
GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE
KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN!
(LAUGHTER)
FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
WILL BE GIVING HER REGULARLY
SCHEDULED PRESS
AVAILABILITY.
OH [BLEEP],IT'S ON!
>> NANCY PELOSI NOW
ADDRESSING THE ANTHONY
WEINER SCANDAL.
>> GOOD MORNING, AS USUAL
WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT
JOBS, ABOUT PROTECTING
MEDICARE, AND TO PROTECTING
THE MIDDLE CLASS.
IF YOU ARE HERE TO ASK A
QUESTION ABOUT CONGRESSMAN
WEINER, I WON'T BE ANSWERING
ANY.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE ECONOMY, JOBS?
NO WEINER TALK?
THE ECONOMY AND JOBS ARE
IMPORTANT.
LET'S GIVE IT A CHANCE.
>> I WILL JUST TELL YOU THAT
UP FRONT.
IT IS DAY 163, 163 DAYS
SINCE THE REPUBLICAN --
>> ALL RIGHT, I ACTUALLY SAW
JOHN KEANE SORT OF GRINNING
MAYBE BECAUSE HE SORT CHED
MUCH EXPECTED THAT AND DANA
BASH, YOU TOO ON THE HILL.
WE THOUGHT THAT POSSIBLY
NANCY PELOSI WOULD TAKE
QUESTIONS RIGHT AWAY,
CONSIDERING THE STORIES
THAT'S BEEN BREAKING FOR
ABOUT 45 MINUTES NOW.
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE NOPE,
SHE'S GOING TO START WITH
JOBS THE MIDDLE CLASS.
>> Jon: LAST TRAIN,
SNOOZEVILLE IS LEAVING.
YOU'RE BORING ME STATION.
THE OTHER 24 FAIRED NO
BETTER, BOTH FOX AND MSNBC
ALSO CUTTING AWAY
IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT BECAME
CLEAR THIS WOULD BE A
WEINERLESS PICNIC.
>> IT IS DAY 163, 163 DAYS
SINCE THE REPUBLICANS HAVE
TAKEN OVER THE MAJORITY OF
THE HOUSE.
>> ALL RIGHT SO, NANCY
PELOSI-- SAYING SHE IS NOT
GOING TO HAVE ANY COMMENT ON
ANTHONY WEINER'S
RESIGNATION.
>> Jon: DID YOU CATCH THAT,
THAT WAS MSNBC, WITH THEIR
LIBERAL BIAS, THEY LET NANCY
PELOSI SAY EIGHT MORE WORDS
THAN CNN.
(LAUGHTER)
BASTARDS!
MY FAVORITE MOMENT OF THE
AFTERNOON HAD TO BELONG TO
OUR GOOD FRIEND WOLF BLITZER
WHO 30 MINUTES AFTER CNN
BAILED ON THE PELOSI JOBS
SPEECH BITTERLY COMPLAINED
ABOUT, WELL, LISTEN.
>> WE HAVE COVERED THESE
KINDS OF STORIES.
IT'S NOT A PLEASURE FOR US.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE LOOK
FORWARD TO.
I WOULD MUCH RATHER BE
DISCUSSING ECONOMIC ISSUES,
JOBS, THE FUTURE OF MEDICARE,
NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> THEN TALKING ABOUT THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: WHAT?
WAIT, WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING
YOU.
WHAT IS STOPPING YOU FROM
DOING THAT?
>> YOU KNOW, SUZANNE, I HAVE
TO TELL YOU, THE ITCHING ON
MY FACE IS NAIRLY UNBEARABLE.
MY VESAGE IN A MIRROR IS NOT
SOMETHING I LOOK FORWARD TO
SEEING.
I WOULD MUCH RATHER MY
FINGERS BE RUNNING AGAINST A
SMOOTH AND CLEAN SKIN
SURFACE BUT, OBVIOUSLY I'M
23409 A FAITION HAIR GOD-- A
FACIAL HAIR GOD.
I'M HELPLESS TO REMOVE IT
