>> RELEASE.

ANYWAY.

THE GREATEST THING THAT HAS EVER
OCCURRED IN LIFE THAT WE MUST GO
THROUGH MONSOONS, OVER MOUNTAINS
BY FOOT TO GET TO, TO, AH, IT'S
A PIECE OF [BLEEPED].
I'M NOT INTERESTED.
AT WHAT POINT IN THAT AGE RANGE?
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT YOUR PARENTING SKILLS...

LITTLE EARLIER.

YOU BOUGHT HIM A TOY?
THEN THEY WOULD SEE THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN...
>> Jon: LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I
DO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THIS IS TRUE.
THIS IS A GOOD POINT YOU BRING
UP.
WHAT I DO IS WHEN WE'RE OUT AND
THERE'S ANOTHER CHILD WITH A TOY
THAT SEEMS NICE, I WILL TAKE IT.
I HAVE SHOWN MY SON THAT IT IS
ALL ABOUT FORCE.
YOU CAN ONLY... IT IS THE POWELL
DOCTRINE, OVERWHELMING FORCE ON
A CHILD.

IS IT MORE OF A... I ALWAYS
WONDER ABOUT THIS.
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SEE THE
MOVIE, AND I COULD LIE TO YOU
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
WE'RE FRIENDS.

SAW THE MOVIE, YOU'RE
TREMENDOUS.
WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU, IS I
TRUST YOU.

ABOUT MY PARENTING SKILLS.
BUT "MORNING GLORY," WHICH IS
[BLEEPED] BRILLIANT, WILL BE IN
THE THEATERS TOMORROW.
HARRISON FORD.
