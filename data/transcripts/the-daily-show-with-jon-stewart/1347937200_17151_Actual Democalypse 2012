>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW.
MY NAME IS IS JON STEWART.
WE'RE BACK HOME, BABY.
BACK FROM THE CONVENTIONS.
VERY EXCITEDDED TONIGHT.
ON OUR PROGRAM KOFI ANNAN WILL BE JOINING US ON THE PROGRAM.
FORMER SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS.
WHAT AN EVENTFUL WEEK.
REMEMBER THE INTERNET, THE MAGICAL FORCE THAT SHOWERED DEMOCRACY ON THE MIDDLE EAST
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ARAB SPRING, HOW WERE PEOPLE ABLE TO AMASS IN VARIOUS PLACES?
TWITTER
>> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE THE ROLE THE INTERNET HAS PLAYED.
THE ARAB SPRING WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT TWITTER AND WITHOUT SOCIAL MEDIA
>> Jon: TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.
OF COURSE HERE WE USE IT TO BLOG THE X-FACTOR.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IT'S AN EXCITING TIME FOR TWITTER.
HEY, WHAT ELSE IS ON THE INTERNET?
LET ME SEE.
THAT'S NOT ARAB SPRING.
DEMOCRACY, NO FREEDOM.
YEAH, THAT'S... I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
WHAT'S THIS?
>> AN INCREDIBLY AMATEURISH, CRUDE AND NASTY MOVIE MADE IN THE UNITED STATES AND RELEASED ON YOU-TUBE, "INNOCENCE OF
MUSLIMS" IT'S CALLED.
IT DEPICTS THE PROPHET MOHAMMED AS A DOPE, A FRAUD, A PEDOPHILE AND WOMANIZER
>> Jon: IT'S YOU-TUBE.
I MEAN NOBODY PAYS ATTENTION TO YOU-TUBE.
WHY NOT HAVE SOME FUN WITH IT.
THAT WILL BE THE LAST WE HEAR OF IT.
WHAT'S THAT NOW IN
>> U.S. EMBASSIES AND CONTINUESATE LaS UNDER SIEGE IN MIDDLE EAST.
AFRICA AND EVEN ASIA.
THIS MAP SHOWS THE UNREST SPREADING TO MORE THAN A DOZEN NATIONS.
>> Jon: I SEE.
THAT BRINGS US TO TONIGHT'S SEGMENT, ACTUAL DEMOCALYPSE.
ALL THIS DESTRUCTION AND BLOODSHED WAS OVER A DUMB INTERNET VIDEO MADE BY SOME
[BLEEP].
AND PROMOTED BY...
( APPLAUSE ) ... AND IT WAS PROMOTED BY THE KORAN-BURNING FLORIDA PASTOR TERRY JONES.
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A CLIP OF HIM AS WELL.
>> A VERY NAUGHTY BOY.
NOW GO AWAY.
>> WHO ARE YOU?
I'M HIS MOTHER, THAT'S WHO Jon: I'M BEING TOLD THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT TERRY JONES MOCKING A DIFFERENT WORLD
RELIGION IN A FILM THAT HAS BEEN ROUND FOR 3 YEARS.
WELL, THAT MUST BE A LOT OF BURNED EMBASSIES... REALLY?
NONE AT ALL.
FAIR ENOUGH.
LOOK, I'M ALL ABOUT CULTURAL SENSITIVITY.
THE WHOLE POINT OF MY 1996 RAB ALBUM.
BUT I HAVE TO SAY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS ONE.
AN ONLINE FILM THAT NOBODY HAS SEEN MADE BY SOME [BLEEP] IS A PRETEXT FOR VIOLENCE.
SOME OF THE LEADERS ARE DELIBERATELY EXPLOITING WHATEVER THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON TO RILE UP THE POPULOUS FOR THEIR
OWN POLITICAL GAIN.
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU REALLY ARE GETTING THE HANG OF THIS DEMOCRACY THING PRETTY FAST.
BY THE WAY, NO ONE OVER THERE WAS FREAKING OUT WHEN EGYPTIAN STATE TELEVISION AIRED A MOVIE BASED ON THE PROTOCOLS OF THE
ELDERS OF ZION WHICH HAS WON THE OSCAR FOR MOST INSULTING FILM EVER SINCE MOVIES WERE INVENTED.
THE WHOLE "JEWS RULE THE WORLD AND KILL CHRISTIAN BABIES." IT'S A TAD OFFENSIVE.
DID THE JEWS GET REVENGE BY BURNING EMBASSIES.
NO WE GOT OUR REVENGE IN THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY, A BAD REVIEW IN THE TIMES AND A RATHER WRY CARTOON POKING FUN OF A FILM IN
THE NEW YORKER WITH A CAT AS A FILM CRITIC WHO DOESN'T WANT...
IT'S VERY WRY.
THE POINT IS YOU WANT TO BE A MATURE COUNTRY YOU NEED A BETTER WAY TO EXPRESS YOUR VIEWING DISPLEASURE.
THE RATING SYSTEM.
I GIVE IT TWO THUMBS OFF.
YOU HAVE TO
