>> Jon: HI, EVERYBODY.
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
BIG SHOW TONIGHT.
EVA MENDES IS JOINING US.
A FINE ACTRESS.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AMERICA, LAND THAT I LOVE.
STANDING BESIDE HER I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE SHE HAS ISSUES THAT NEED ADDRESSES VEESA SEE VIS A
VIS ECONOMICS AND PEOPLE IN GROCERY STORES THROWING MILK SO THEY CAN SLIP.
TAKE THAT MINIMUM WAGE MOP PERSON THAT HAS TO CLEAN THAT UP.
A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT NEED FIXING.
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING STANDING IN OUR WAY.
>> THE REPUBLICANS DON'T SEEM TO GET IT.
INSTEAD OF WORKING POUR THE PEOPLE THEY WOULD RATHER WORK TO OBSTRUCT.
>> OBSTRUCTION IS THE ORTHODOX.
THEY THINK COMPROMISE SAY DIRTY WORD.
>> THE POLICY SEEMS TO BE JUST SAY NO.
>> REPUBLICANS HAVE CLOG ORDER BLOCKED EVERYTHING WE'VE TRIED TO DO.
>> Jon: YES!
BECAUSE OF REPUBLICANS NOTHING CAN PASS THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE BODY KEEPING AMERICA BACKED UP.
[ LAUGHTER ]
UNABLE TO SQUEEZE OUT THE SIMPLEST LEGISLATION SO BLOATED -- I'M SORRY JUST A COUPLE DAYS INTO THIS PASSOVER
THING AND MY GOD WHAT IS IT ABOUT MATZAH WHEN IT HITS STOMACH ACID IT TURNS TO CEMENT.
SURE WHEN YOU ARE WANDERING IN THE DESERT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEXT BATHROOM IS GOING TO BE
THIS IS MODERN SOCIETY.
POINT IS CAN A BROTHER GET A PRUNE AL MONDAY.
SOME BELIEVE GOVERNMENT CAN HELP.
>> I REJECT THE VIEW THAT SAYS OUR PROBLEMS WILL TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES, THAT SAYS GOVERNMENT
HAS NO ROLE.
THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE A FORCE FOR GOOD SHOULD WORK HARDER THAN
ANYONE TO REFORM IT SO IT'S LEANER, MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE RESPONSIVE FOR THE PEOPLE.
>> Jon: THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO A LOT FOR US.
WE HAVE TO WHIP IT INTO SHAISM GET IT BIKINI READY.
WAIT A MINUTE,.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I SAID BIKINI
