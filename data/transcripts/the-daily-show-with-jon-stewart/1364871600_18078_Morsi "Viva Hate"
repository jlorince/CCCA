I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS NEW EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT MOHAMMED MORSI HAS GOT HIS HANDS FULL.
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW HE TACKLES THESE COMPLEX AND URGENT ISSUE
>> THE PROSECUTORS HAVE ORDERED THE ARREST OF POPULAR TELEVISION PRODUCER BASSEM YOUSEF
>> Jon: WHO IS THAT GUY?
HAS HE BEEN SABOTAGING INFRASTRUCTURE OR HARASSING EGYPTIAN WOMEN ON THE STREET OR
UNEMPLOYING EGYPTIAN.

WHAT DID HE DO?

>> THE COUNTRY'S TOP PROSECUTOR ISSUED AN ARREST WARRANT CHARGING THE COMEDIAN WITH
INSULTING BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND ISLAM.
>> Jon: THAT'S ILLEGAL?
SERIOUSLY, THAT'S ILLEGAL IN EGYPT BECAUSE IF INSULTING THE PRESIDENT AND ISLAM WERE A

OVER THERE, YOU CANNOT INSULT RELIGION.
I'M JUST CURIOUS, WHAT WOULD SOMETHING LIKE INSULTING RELIGION SOUND LIKE ANYWAY?

WOW.
I'M SURE THAT WHEN PRESIDENT MORSI HEARS ABOUT THAT, HE IS GOING TO BE SO... I'M SORRY.
