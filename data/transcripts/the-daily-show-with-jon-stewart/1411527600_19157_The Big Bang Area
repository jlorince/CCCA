>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW"!
MY NAME IS JON STEWART. WE'VEGOT A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, INCREDIBLETIMING -- WE DID NOT PLAN IT --
GENERAL AND FORMER COMMANDER OFCENTCOM, ANTHONY ZINNI
IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. HEHAS A NEW BOOK OUT,
"BEFORE THE FIRST SHOTS AREFIRED." THAT'S HIS NEW BOOK.
I ONLY CAN REALLY ONLY SAY TOHIM, TOO LATE!
>> THERE IS BREAKING NEWSTONIGHT. THE PENTAGON SAYS
THAT AIRSTRIKES AGAINST I.S.I.S.IN SYRIA HAS BEGUN.
>> WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FORWEEKS AND HERE IT IS TONIGHT.
>> Jon: OOH, IT'S SOANTICIPATED!
IT WAS THE  IPHONE 6 OF WARS!
(LAUGHTER)IT'S EXPENSIVE, A LITTLE
BIGGER...
A LITTLE MORE UNWIELDY THAN YOUTHOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE.
(LAUGHTER)IT'S GOING TO BE AT LEAST A
TWO-YEAR COMMITMENT.
(APPLAUSE)KIND OF FEELS LIKE YOU JUST
(BLEEP) GOT THE LAST ONE.(LAUGHTER)
BUT, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, ATLEAST IT'S NOT THE WATCH.
SO HOW DID THE NEW PRODUCTLAUNCH GO?
>> THEY ATTACKED I.S.I.S.TARGETS AT FOUR LOCATIONS
INSIDE SYRIA, INCLUDINGHEADQUARTERS BUILDINGS, STORAGE
FACILITIES, A FINANCE CENTER,SUPPLY TRUCKS, ARMED VEHICLES
AND TRAINING COMPOUNDS.
>> Jon: CAN I BACK THAT UP FORJUST A SECOND?
I.S.I.S. HAS A FINANCE CENTER?
I.S.I.S. HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCEFOR, LIKE, A MONTH...
THEY'VE GOT A FINANCE INDUSTRY?
NO, NO, THAT DESK IS FORBOMBINGS AND MASS KILLINGS.
YOU WANT SMALL BUSINESS LOANS,THAT'S DOWN THE HALL.
SO WE HIT FOUR LOCATIONS, FOUR,FOR A VERY NARROWLY-FOCUSED,
MINIMALIST APPROACH.
>> THEY DESCRIBED THE STRIKES ASVERY SUCCESSFUL AND ONLY THE
BEGINNING. WE ALSO GOT A MENUOF THE WEAPONRY INVOLVED.
GET A LIST OF THE DEVICES HERE.
TOMAHAWK MISSILES.
F-22 AIRCRAFT, F-15s, F-16s,F-18s.
>> Jon: ALL THE Fs WERETHERE!
CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
F THOSE GUYS!
THAT'S WHAT I SAY! (LAUGHTER)
NOW THE BIG WORRY AHEAD OF ALLTHIS WAS THAT
WE WOULD HAVE TO GOINTO THIS FIGHT ALONE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR!
(WHISPERING)>> WE'RE TOLD FOUR ARAB NATIONS
ARE ALSO FLYING IN THE MISSIONSOVER SYRIA, SAUDI ARABIA,
JORDAN, BAHRAIN AND THE UNITEDARAB EMIRATES.
DEFENSE OFFICIALS SAY A FIFTHNATION, QATAR, IS ALSO HELPING
IN THE EFFORT BUT NOT BY AIR.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE THEY"CATERING?"
WHAT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
HOW IS QATAR HELPING?WE'RE DOING AIRSTRIKES.
WHAT ARE THEY GIVING I.S.I.S.THE SILENT TREATMENT?
AND THEN WHEN I.S.I.S. IS ALL,LIKE, QATAR, WHAT'S WRONG?
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?
QATAR'S LIKE -- NAH, IT'S COOL.
AND IT WASN'T JUST QATAR WHOSEROLE WAS LEFT ALARMINGLY VAGUE.
THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY WASENOUGH TO BREAK 32-YEAR WAR
CORRESPONDENT VETERAN JIMMIKLASZEWSKI.
>> SO FAR BAHRAIN HAS STEPPEDFORWARD TO SAY, YES, THEY
FLEW IN THAT MISSION BUT IT'SNOT CLEAR WHAT THEY
DID IN THAT MISSION.DID THEY, YOU KNOW, CUT DONUTS
IN THE SKY OVER IRAQ FOR, YOUKNOW, TWO HOURS?
>> Jon: WHAT? DOING DONUTS INTHE SKY?
JIM, I'M SURE THEY WEREN'T JUSTDOING DONUTS IN THE SKY!
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LISTEN TOTHE COCKPIT RECORDINGS.
LET'S JUST...I'M SORRY. I STANDCORRECTED.
MAYBE THEY WERE DOING DONUTS.
WELL, ALL RIGHT. THE COALITIONHAS ATTACKED.
WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE FROMI.S.I.S.?
>> ITS CHIEF SPOKESPERSON URGEDSUPPORTERS AROUND THE WORLD, IF
YOU CAN KILL A DISBELIEVINGAMERICAN OR EUROPEAN, ESPECIALLY
THE SPITEFUL FRENCH OR ANAUSTRALIAN OR A CANADIAN.
>> Jon: SPITEFUL AND FILTHYFRENCH, I'LL GIVE YOU.
CAN'T NECESSARILY ARGUE THAT.BUT WHAT'S WITH TOSSING IN
AUSTRALIAN OR CANADIAN, ASAN AFTERTHOUGHT, LIKE THEY'RE
PROFESSOR AND MARYANN OF INFIDELS. YOU KNOW WHAT,
IF THAT'S THE BEST YOU'VE GOTSNAPS-WISE I.S.I.S.,
I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO PRETTYWELL IN THE MEDIA WAR.
>> THEY CALLED JOHN KERRY ANUNCIRCUMCISED OLD GEEZER.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THAT'S SO SPECIFIC!
I CAN'T BELIEVE I.S.I.S. HASINFILTRATED JOHN KERRY'S PANTS!
BUT YOU KNOW KERRY'S NOT GOINGTO PUT UP WITH THAT (BLEEP).
KERRY'S GOING TO FIRE BACK, HE'SGOING TO BE, LIKE, WHILST YOUR
CHARACTERIZATION OF ME HASSOME VALIDITY, I BELIEVE IN MY
HEART THAT, ALTHOUGH MANY OF YOUHAVE HAD YOUR FORESKIN
REMOVED, WHETHER IT BE FORCULTURAL OR RELIGIOUS CUSTOM,
I AM OF THE UNDERSTANDING THATTHE INDIVIDUAL WHO PERFORMED
THAT PROCEDURE, IN THEIRCARELESSNESS, WHETHER THROUGH
HASTE OR INTENT, MAY HAVESIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE LENGTH
OF YOUR PENIS!
BOOM!
(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)
THERE WE GO.
SO THE BOMBING HAS BEGUN.
THE COALITION HAS BEENASSEMBLED.
IT'S TIME TO FOCUS 100% ONATTACKING I.S.I.S.
>> AT THE SAME TIME U.S. JETSWERE ATTACKING I.S.I.S. TARGETS,
THEY ALSO FLEW A NUMBER OFMISSIONS AGAINST A DIFFERENT
TERRORIST GROUP KNOWN ASKHORASAN.
>> Jon: WAIT. WHO THE WHATNOW? WAIT? WHO?
KHORASAN -- WE JUST DECIDED THATSO LONG AS WE'RE ATTACKING IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WE'REGOING TO SWING BY AND BOMB
THESE OTHER CATS TOO SO WE COULDWHAT, USE THE BOMB-POOLING LANE?
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHO ISKHORASAN GROUP?
>> KHORASAN IS A SHADOWYGROUP OF ABOUT 50 VETERAN
AL QAEDA FIGHTERS FROMAFGHANISTAN WHO THE U.S.,
AS ADMIRAL KIRBY SAYS, CONSIDERSFAR MORE DANGEROUS THAN I.S.I.S.
>> Jon: WHAT THE -- WHAT THE(BLEEP)?
YOU JUST TOLD US I.S.I.S. WASLIKE IF GODZILLA AND THE DEVIL
(BLEEP) ON A BED OF EBOLA.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S MOREDANGEROUS THAN I.S.I.S.?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OH, I.S.I.S. IS THE WORST THINGWE'VE EVER BUT THIS NEW MAKES
I.S.I.S. SEEM NICEST.
YOU WISH THIS GROUP WERE AS NICEAS I.S.I.S.!
>> OFFICIALS SAY THEY WERE INTHE FINAL STAGES OF FABRICATING
CUTTING EDGE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES,INSIDE TOOTHPASTE TUBES OR WITH
CLOTHING DIPPED IN LIQUIDEXPLOSIVES THAT COULD EXPLODE ON
AN AIRPLANE AND NOT BEDETECTED.
>> Jon: NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVETO FLY NAKED AND FLUSHED WITH
TARTAR. AND WITH AN AGING HEAD,AN ODDLY ANACHRONISTIC
PUBESCENT BODY. KIND OF AWEIRD LOOK.
ALL RIGHT WHITE HOUSE.
CAN WE AT LEAST ADMIT THAT WEARE AT WAR?
>> NOT JUST A COUNTERTERRORISMOPERATION, NOT JUST POLICE
ACTION.
IT'S A WAR.
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACOUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGY THAT
WILL APPLY TO THIS SITUATIONTHAT WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY
APPLIED IN OTHER PLACES.
>> Jon: SUCCESSFULLY? WHATEVERFLOATS YOUR BOAT.
