PROTECTING THESE SCHOOLS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOT ONLY WAS OBAMA GUILTY OF EXECUTIVE OVERREACH, YESTERDAY OHM BALM YAFS GUILTY OF
EXECUTIVE OVER DRA TIESATION.
>> USING CHILDREN RAISING THE EMOTIONAL HACKELS.
>> I FIND IT DESPICABLE.
LET'S SEE FIT MERITS IT OUT.
>> Jon: YES THAT WAS MANIPULATE ACTIVE (bleep).
THAT WAS STAGECRAFT NO QUESTION.
WHICH I THINK YOU CAN ARGUE ABOUT AND THE RIGHT HAS BEEN TRYING TRYING TO HARD TO MAINTAIN A
RATIONAL DIALOG ABOUT GUN FNCHES HE DOES EXECUTIVE ORDERS HE IS BECOME LIKE CHAVEZ.
>> LIKE HITLER, LIKE MAO.
>> IT HAPPENED IN ITALY, SPAIN, IEW AND GOOD YANCH EVEN USING CHILDREN.
>> REMINDS ME OF SADDAM HUSSEIN WHEN HE USED KIDS.
>> Jon: WOW!
IT'S LIKE A GAME OF $25,000 PYRAMID WHERE THE CATEGORIES ARE DICTATORS OR UNFLATTERING MUSTACHES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MAYBE WE'RE NOT READY TO HAVE A SPECIFIC CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT GOVERNMENT CAN DO ABOUT GUN
VIOLENCE UNTIL WE HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING ON HOW WE RECORD OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE GOVERNMENT.
IF THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GO FIRST.
AND TURN IN THEIR ASSAULT WEAPONS THAT THEY ENGAGE --
>> Jon: SIT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SEE NOW WE'RE HAVING A RATIONALE LOGICAL CONVERSATION.
SO IN YOUR MIND, YOU BELIEVE GUN CONTROL IS AN ARMS TREATY TBHOATION OUR U.S. MILITARY AS
THE FOUNDERS INTENDED.
HERE IS WHAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THIS:  THE WHIFF OF SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY.
IF YOU ARE GIRDING YOURSELF WITH A MASSIVE BATTLE WITH A UBER-GOVERNMENT STOCKING UP ON
CANS OF MUSHROOM SOUP FIT DOESN'T HAPPEN YOU LIKE LIKE AN (bleep) WITH A SOUP FETISH.
BUT NO ONE IS GOING TOLL TELL YOU THAT -- GOING TO TELL YOU THAT TO YOUR FACE.
BUT THE ONLY WAY YOUR LIFE WOULD BE MEANINGFUL WOULD BE IN THE TYRANNY COMES TRUE WHICH PUTS
YOU IN THE DIFFICULT POSITION OF HAVING TO ARGUE TYRANNY HYPOTHETICALS.
>> I AM JEWISH.
I THINK WHAT WOULD THE GERMAN JEWS HAVE DONE WITH A STOCKPILE OF WEAPONS?
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MURDERED.
>> Jon: I WISH -- YOU CAN'T EVER KNOW HOW HISTORY WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT UNLESS YOU HAVE A
DEDLRKS LOREAN.
I WISH THAT ARMED JEWS IN THE GHETTO COULD HAVE STOPPED THEM BUT FRANCE COULDN'T AND I'M
PRETTY SURE THEY HAD GUNS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
RUSSIA, RUSSIA HAD KIND OF A LOT OF GUNS AND THEY COULDN'T STOP HITLER UNTIL YOU FACTORED IN THE WINDCHILL.
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S AN ALL OF LOT TO PUT ON AN OPPRESSED MINORITY WHEN IT TOOK THE FREE WORLD 5-6 OF ALL ALL
TOTAL WORE -- WAR TO STOP THAT (bleep).
LET'S STOP ARGUING WHAT IF.
>> I THINK MARTIN LUTHER KING WOULD AGREE WITH ME IF HE WERE ALIVE TODAY.
>> Jon: YEAH, HOW DID HE DIE AGAIN?
BUT GO ON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
GO ON.
NO, IT'S GOOD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND REMEMBER MONDAY IS HIS BIRTHDAY.
GO AHEAD.
>> THAT IF AFRICAN-AMERICANS HAD BEEN GIVEN THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS FROM DAY ONE OF
COUNTRY'S FOUNDING PERHAPS SLAVERY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A CHAPTER IN OUR HISTORY.
>> Jon: THEY SAY IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.
♪ ♪ YES, IF ONLY THE AFRICANS BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY IN CHAINS HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO HAVE
GUNS, AH -- ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY GIVEN THE CLIMATE OF THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME WOULD THEY HAVE
GOTTEN WHOLE GUNS OR THREE-FIFTHS OF A GUN?
WE WILL NEVER KNOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I JUST WANT TO SAY, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANY PUSH BACK IN THIS COUNTRY ON YOUR POINT ABOUT
NOT WANTING OR LIKING TYRANNY.
THE QUESTION IS A DISAGREEMENT IN JUST HOW CLOSE WE ARE TEETERING ON THE EDGE OF IT AND
WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE CONFUSING TYRANNY WITH THE UNPLEASANT SENSATION OF LOSING ELECTIONS
WHICH WE JUST HAD.
IF OBAMA WERE A TYRANT ARE THESE THE NUMBERS HE WOULD PUT UP?
TYRANTS DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT THAT (bleep) HARD FOR OHIO.
AND GENERALLY -- GENERALLY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
ING FOR ABOUT UTTERLY TANKING YOUR FIRST DEBATE, TYRANTS DON'T SHOW UP FOR THOSE.
THE REAL DEBATE FOR TYRANTS IS HOW BIG YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE SUNGLASSES?
I GUESS IT'S SUMMED BY THE OLD HOMILY FIRST THEY CAME FOR THE GUNS AND I SAID NOTHING BECAUSE
THEY
