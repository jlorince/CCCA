>> Jon: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS SO
EXCITING.
THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THESE
UNITED STATES AND RECENT FATHER
OF BRIDE MR. WILLIAM JEFFERSON
CLINTON WILL BE JOINING US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE'LL GET RIGHT TO IT, FOLKS.
OUR TOP STORY COMING OUST EUROPE
THE POPE OR BIG PAPI AS THEY
CALL HIM IN BOSTON LEFT ITALY TO
VISIT THE UNITED KINGDOM.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
I --
[LAUGHTER]
-- I'M SORRY I CAN'T DO THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
I'M SURE THE 500 YEARS IN THE
MAKING RECONCILIATION OF THE DE
FACTO HEAD OF AINGE -- ANGLICAN
CHURCH AND THE DE FACTO LEAD YES
OF CATHOLICS IS INTERESTING TO
SOSOME BUT THE BUZZ I'M HEARING
ON THE STREETS, IN THE CAFES,
SOME OF YOUR NICER UNISEX
BATHROOMS IS THAT PEOPLE CAN
TALK ABOUT LITTLE ELSE THAN
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED ON THIS
VERY PROGRAM NOT TWO WEEKS AGO.
I JON STEWART AM ANNOUNCING THAT
I WILL HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
SOMETIME.
[LAUGHTER]
IT WAS --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I KNOW YOU REMEMBER, TOO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT WAS THE PREANNOUNCEMENT HEARD
ROUND THE WORLD.
[LAUGHTER]
MANY SAY RIFF VYING IN --
RIVALLING THE NIGHT BEFORE
MARTIN LUTHER KING'S I HAVE A
DREAM SPEECH WHEN HE
PREANNOUNCED I'M GOING TO SLEEP
NOW.
LET'S SEE HOW THIS TURNS OUT.
COURTESY OF THE KING ARCHIVES.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, FRIENDS, THE TIME FOR
PREANNOUNCEMENTS IS PASSED.
TONIGHT I BRING YOU THE ACTUAL
ANNOUNCEMENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BUT FIRST --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IF I MAY, HOW DID WE GET HERE?
[LAUGHTER]
WE LIVE IN TROUBLED TIMES WITH
REAL PEOPLE FACING VERY REAL
PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS THAT HAVE
REAL IF IMPERFECT SOLUTIONS AND
I BELIEVE 70% TO 80% OF OUR
POPULATION COULD AGREE TO TRY
AND COULD ULTIMATELY LIVE WITH.
UNFORTUNATELY THE CONVERSATION
AND PROCESS IS CONTROLLED BY THE
OTHER 15% TO 20%.
YOU MAY KNOW THEM AS THE PEOPLE
WHO BELIEVE THAT OBAMA IS SECRET
MUSLIM PLANNING A SOCIALIST
TAKEOVER OF AMERICA SO HE CAN
FORCE HIS RADICAL BLACK
CHRISTIANITY DOWN OUR THROATS OR
THAT GEORGE W. BUSH LET 9/11
HAPPEN TO PAD DICK CHENEY'S
HALLIBURTON STOCK PORT FOAL
YOASM YOU'VE SEEN THE SIGNS
OBAMA IS HITLER, BUSH IS HITLER.
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM, PEOPLE, DO
HAVE YOU NO IDEA WHAT A STALIN
MUSTACHE LOOKS LIKE?
IT'S SIMPLE TO DRAW.
THINK SUPERMARIO'S MUSTACHE WITH
WARIO'S PERSONALITY.
WE HAVE SEEN --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WE HAVE AN AUDIENCE OF NINE YEAR
OLDS.
[LAUGHTER]
WE HAVE SEEN THESE FOLKS, THE
LOUD FOLKS OVER THE YEARS
DOMINATE OUR NATIONAL
CONVERSATION ON OUR MOST
IMPORTANT ISSUES.
>> THE REPUBLICANS WANT YOU TO
DIE QUICKLY IF YOU GET SICK.
>> OBAMA'S PLAN IS GOING IF KILL
YOU -- GOING TO KILL YOU.
>> OBAMA HAS GONE COMPLETELY
BRAIN DEAD.
>> OBAMA IS DESTROYING THIS
COUNTRY.
>> DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA
IS SAY SOCIALIST.
>> SURE.
>> THOSE CRAZED TEA BAGGERS.
>> WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK NL
R.
>> KILL THE BILL.
>> YOU ARE GOING TO ROT IN HELL.
OBAMA INTHE MEDIA INSULTS
PEOPLE.
>> GO (bleep) YOURSELF MR. --
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME, OWE --
OBAMA.
PRESIDENT OBAMA ARE YOU LISTEN
SOMETHING IN.
>> ARE YOU LISTENING?
>> FORGET ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: YES.
AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S EASY TO GET
CAUGHT UP IN IT.
WHY DON'T WE HEAR FROM THE 70%
TO 80%?
WELL, MOST LIKELY BECAUSE YOU
HAVE (bleep) TO DO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND QUITE FRANKLY EVEN IF YOU
DIDN'T HAVE (bleep) TO DO, YOU
MAY LOOK THE THEE AT CALL FLARE
NECESSARY FOR TODAY'S 24 HOUR A
DAY, SEVEN DAY A WEEK NEWS
MEDIA.
YOU MAY HAVE AN ASSAULT RIFLE
BUT DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE
TO BRING TO A RALLY FILLED WITH
YOUR BRETHREN.
YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN A TOPIC
BUT NOT DRESS ALL IN PINK.
COVER YOUR HANDS IN FAKE BLOOD
AND ACT YOU SNIEWK A MEET
MEETING THAT IS A PUBLIC IN THE
FIRST PLACE (bleep)
INTERESTED.
TONIGHT I ANNOUNCE THE RALLY TO
RESTORE SANITY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT IS HAPPENING, PEOPLE.
IT IS HAPPENING!
IT IS HAPPENING!
A REAL GATHERING --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- WE WILL GATHER.
WE WILL GATHER ON THE NATIONAL
MALL IN WASHINGTON, D.C., A
MILLION MODERATE MARCH WHERE WE
TAKE TO THE STREETS TO SEND A
MESSAGE TO OUR LEADERS AND OUR
NATIONAL MEDIA THAT SAYS WE ARE.
WE'RE ONLY HERE THOUGH UNTIL
6:00 BECAUSE WE HAVE A SITTER.
A CLARION CALL FOR RATIONALITY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS WILL TAKE PLACE ON
SATURDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2010.
YOU ARE PROBABLY SAYING OCTOBER
30, 2010 THAT RINGS A BELL.
THE 36th ANNIVERSARY OF THE
RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE IN ZAIRE.
YES.
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY THE DATE IS
SIGNIFICANT.
I'LL TELL YOU THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF OCTOBER 30:  YOU SEE, "THE
DAILY SHOW" IS ALREADY GOING TO
BE IN WASHINGTON DOING SHOWS
FROM MONDAY THE 25th TO
THURSDAY THE 28th.
WE THOUGHT IF WE DID IT FRIDAY
WE WERE GOING TO BE REALLY FIRED
FROM DOING THE SHOWS SO WE
THOUGHT WE COULD USE A DAY TO
YOU KNOW, THEN WE WERE THINKING
ABOUT SUNDAY.
THAT'S HALLOWEEN.
A LOT OF KIDS WOASM LIKE TO SEE
THEM TRICK-OR-TREAT BECAUSE IT
GOES SO FAST.
[LAUGHTER]
SO OCTOBER 30 THAT MAKES THE
MOST SENSE.
[LAUGHTER]
ANYWAY, YOU MAY BE ASKING --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU MAY BE ASKING YOURSELF RIGHT
NOW SITTING AT HOME, BUT AM I
THE RIGHT TYPE OF FOREIGN GO TO
THIS -- PERSON TO GO TO THIS
RALLY?
THE FACT THAT YOU WOULD EVEN
STOP TO ASK YOURSELF THAT
QUESTION AS OPPOSE TO JUMPING
UP, GRABBING THE NEXT STACK OF
BURNABLE HOLY BOOKS RATHER THAN
GRABBING A CAR AND MOVING TO
D.C., THAT MEANS YOU JUST MIGHT
BE RIGHT FOR IT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I SEE YOU ARE INTRIGUED.
I SEE YOU ARE INTRIGUED BUT
THERE'S SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU.
AS A REASONABLE BUSY PERSON, I
WOULD LOVE TO COME, JON BUT I
DON'T HAVE TIME HANDCRAFT A
MESSAGE AND SIGNAGE.
NOT TO WORRY.
THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SIGNS FOR
YOU DOWN THERE.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME.
OF COURSE, YOU CAN BRING YOUR
OWN BUT HERE IS A QUICK ONE.
I DISAGREE WITH YOU, BUT I'M
PRETTY SURE YOU ARE NOT HITLER.
[LAUGHTER]
OOH, HOW ABOUT THIS FOR THE
DISSATISFIED YET NOT IDEA
LOGICAL AMONGST US:  GOT
CONFIDENCE?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I NOTICED THERE'S A LOT OF
CONSPIRACY RALLY STUFF GOING ON
AT THESE THINGS.
HERE IS ONE FOR OUR RALLY, 9/11
WAS AN OUTSIDE JOB.
HERE IS ONE:  LEGALIZE POT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NOW --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I'M GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS GOT IN
THERE.
TURNS OUT ANY TIME YOU HAVE A
STACK OF SIGNS THIS ONE SEEMS TO
END UP IN IT.
WE DIDN'T PUT IT IN THERE.
I THINK THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN SIGNS BREED.
[LAUGHTER]
PERHAPS THIS ONE IS MORE TO THE
POINT.
I AM NOT AFRAID OF MUSLIMS, TEA
PARTYERS, IMMIGRANTS, GAYS, BUT
I AM KIND OF SCARED OF SPIDERS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS RALLY THAT IS REAL IS A DAY
THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY -- [PHONE
RINGING]
HELLO ONE SECOND.
HELLO.
NOT THAT ONE.
HOLD ON.
I THINK IT'S THIS PHONE.
HELLO, YEAH.

>> Jon: STEPHEN COLBERT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

MIDDLE --
>> Stephen: ANNOUNCING YOUR
RALLY.
OH, I'M WALL WEAR OF WHAT YOU

YOU ARE UP TO, JON I'M LOOKING
AT YOU RIGHT NOW.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD!

-LE AND PEEPS TO A
GLORIFIED NOODLE FEST ON THE
MALL YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER THING
