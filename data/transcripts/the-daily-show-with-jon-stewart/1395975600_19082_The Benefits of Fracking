WELL, THE UNITED STATES -- THEUNITED STATES HAS RECENTLY BEGUN
TO TAP ITS VASTS RESERVES OFNATURAL GAS THANKS TO THE
DRILLING PROCESS OFHYDROFRACKING OR FRACKING
BECAUSE TWO EXTRA SYLLABLES ISNOT THE AMERICAN WAY.
BUT ARE WE PREPARED TO PAY THECOST?
AASIF MANDVI REPORTS WE ALL KNOWTHE BENEFITS OF FRACKING BUT
RESIDENTS OF FRACKING EFFECTEDBRADFORD COUNTY PENNSYLVANIA SAY
IT ALSO HAS SOME MINORDOWNSIDES.
>> FRACKING HAS RUINED OURQUALITY OF LIFE.

COUNTY.
>> EVERY DAY THERE'S SOMETHINGNEW THAT HAPPENS.
>> I'VE HAD RASHES.
>> NEUROLOGICAL PROBLEMS. SLEEPDISRUPTION.
>> COWS HAVE HAD NOSEBLEEDS.
>> MAYBE THE COWS WERE DOINGCOCAINE.
>> I NEVER CAUGHT THEM DOINGCOCAINE.
>> REALLY.
MARITA NOON FROM ENERGY MAKESAMERICA GREAT
DOESN'T SEE APROBLEM WITH FRACKING.
>> FRACKING IS SAFE.
BECAUSE THE AVERAGE PERSONDOESN'T UNDERSTAND FRACKING THE
ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE ABLE TOUSE FEAR, UNCERTAINTY AND DOUBT
TO PLANT IDEAS INTO PEOPLE'SMINDS AND THEY DON'T DO THE
RESEARCH FOR THEMSELVES.
YOU NEED A TISSUE.
>> YEAH.
>> BUT THE GAS COMPANIES HAVEDONE THE RESEARCH ALONG WITHPLENTY
OF INVESTIGATIONS INTO THERESIDENTS' EXPLAIN COMPLAINTS.
>> IF I POLLUTED MY NEIGHBOR'SWATER WELL DO YOU THINK THAT THE
DEP WILL ALLOW ME TO CONDUCT MYOWN INVESTIGATION AND GET BACK
TO THEM ON IT.
>> IF YOUR WATER IS CONTAMINATEDWHY NOT GO TO THE LOCAL STORE
AND GET YOURSELF EVIAN.
>> I HAVE DONE THAT. THE STORESDON'T HAVE WATER ON THE SHELVES.

WE LIVE OUT A BOTTLE.

DALLAS.
>> A DOZEN SMALL EARTHQUAKESOVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WERE AN
INDIRECT RESULT OF FRACKING.

>> IF A WELL EXPLODES, THECOMPANIES SHOULD AT LEAST ALERT
THE LAND OWNER.
>> WHAT IS MORE DIRECT THAN THESMOKE SIGNAL AND THE SMELL OF
SULFER?
>> THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY ISNOT RESPONSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE
AROUND HERE.
>> ACTUALLY THEY COULDN'T BEMORE RESPONSIBLE LIKE WHEN A GAS
WELL EXPLODED IN GREEN COUNTYPENNSYLVANIA CHEVRON CAME TO THE
RESCUE WITH IMMEDIATECOMPENSATION.
