>> Jon: EXACTLY.
TEN YEARS OF CLINTON GLOBALINITIATIVE.
SO YOU HAVE THIS THING ALLPLANNED OUT. YOU'VE GOT
THESE TREMENDOUS SPEAKERS, ALLYOUR THINGS IN ORDER.
SOMETHING LIKE THIS EBOLAEPIDEMIC JUMPS UP -- IT PROBABLY
REPRESENTS THE CONFLUENCE OF ALLTHE VARIOUS THINGS THAT YOU CAN
DO AT CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE.
HOW AGILE CAN YOU BE WHENSOMETHING LIKE THAT ARISES AND
CAN YOU ADDRESS IT EVEN AT THISYEAR'S CONFERENCE?
>> YEAH, WE ARE.
>> HOW?
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL THEPEOPLE FROM THE WORLD HEALTH
ORGANIZATION AND THE U.N. ANDTHE DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS,
PARTNERS IN HEALTH, ALL THESEPEOPLE ARE GONNA COME TOGETHER
AND TALK ABOUT IT.
THE UNITED STATES HAS DONE ALOT.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S GOTTEN SOMEMONEY THROUGH CONGRESS AND THE
PENTAGON'S COMMITTED A GOOD BITOF MONEY AND RESOURCES.
LOOK, THIS IS AN EMERGENCYBECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO CURE
THIS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE KNOW THAT ALMOST 5,000PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INFECTED.
WE KNOW THAT MORE THAN 2,600HAVE DIED.
ALMOST CERTAINLY MORE THAN THATHAVE BEEN INFECTED.
THE PROBLEM IS, AS COMPARED WITHPREVIOUS OUTBREAKS OF EBOLA,
WHICH ARE IN THE REMOTE RURAL AREAS, THIS IS HIT IN SOME
URBAN AREAS, AND WHEN IT GOTINTO NIGERIA AND THE CONGO,
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THERE ARE JUST SO MANY
BODIES BRUSHING UP AGAINST ONEANOTHER EVERY DAY,
IT INCREASES THE RISK.
YOU HAVE TO ISOLATE AND CAREFOR.
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE CANSURVIVE IF THEY GET PROPER CARE
QUICKLY AND WE CAN STOP THEEPIDEMIC AND LET IT BURN ITSELF
OUT IF WE CAN ISOLATE EVERYBODYTHAT'S INFECTED BUT IT'S GONNA
TAKE A HURCULEAN EFFORT.
>> Jon: RIGHT. IS THE IDEA TO,SINCE YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON THE
GROUND, YOU KNOW, IFORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NOT AS
FAMILIAR WITH THE LOCAL ANDPROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES DOWN
THERE, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THEBIG ISSUES IS TRUST.
THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE VERYFRIGHTENED BY THIS,
JUSTIFIABLY SO. >> THEY SHOULD BE.
>> Jon: AND THEY MAY NOTNECESSARILY TRUST OUTSIDERS
COMING IN, THE UNITEDSTATES COMING IN.
HOW IS IT THAT, CAN YOURORGANIZATION BUILD THROUGH THOSE
MORE LOCAL AUTHORITIESAND BUILD THE TRUST
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED?
>> WELL, WE CAN IN LIBERIA WHEREWE'RE VERY ACTIVE...
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT. >> AND HAVE BEEN THERE, YOU
KNOW, FROM THE BEGINNING OFPRESIDENT JOHNSON'S TENURE.
BUT IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THEYWILL HAVE TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL
HEALTH MINISTRIES, THEY'LLHAVE TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL
PEOPLE WHICH IS WHY IT'SENCOURAGING TO ME THAT WE MAY
HAVE AN AFRICAN COORDINATOR.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHO WILL HAVE, I THINK, A LOTOF CREDIBILITY WORKING WITH THE
OVERALL U.N. COORDINATOR AND THEWORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND
EVERYBODY ELSE.
I THINK, BY AND LARGE, DOCTORSWITHOUT BORDERS DESERVES AN
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF CREDIT.>> Jon: UNBELIEVABLE.
>> BECAUSE THEY HAVE PUT THEIR
LIVES AT RISK AND PUT EVERYTHINGINTO IT.
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE GONE THERETO SERVE, AND NOW THAT PARTNERS
IN HEALTH IS GOING IN, THEPARTNERS IN HEALTH IS MY PARTNER
IN AFRICA AND THEY'VE DONE A LOTOF WORK IN AFRICA AND THEY HAVE
A VERY GOOD NAME.
WE'RE GOING TO, I THINK, SEE ABIG RAMP UP, AND I THINK, IN
LIBERIA, I SAW A NEWS STORYWHICH JUST INTERVIEWED PEOPLE ON
THE STREET...>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHO WERE REALLY THRILLEDTHAT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND
THE MILITARY WERE GOINGTO INVEST IN DOING THIS.
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING INAFRICA WITH THE MILITARY SINCE I
WAS PRESIDENT.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THERE'S ANAFRICA COMMAND NOW AND THEY'RE
VERY WELL ORGANIZED. I EXPECTTHIS TO GET BETTER...
>> Jon: RIGHT. THE AFRICACOMMAND, THAT'S, WHAT, THAT'S,
HOW OLD IS THAT, 20YEARS? IS THAT?
>> WELL, WE FIRST OF ALLORGANIZED THE TRAINING PROGRAM
IN WEST AFRICA AND THEN, AFTER ILEFT OFFICE, THEY TURNED
IT INTO A SEPARATE COMMAND.
SO THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ABOUT17 YEARS, I THINK.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.UNBELIEVABLE.
WELL, IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT THEINFRASTRUCTURE PAYING OFF IN THE
FUTURE.
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'RE GOINGTO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX THE
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD THATARE BROKEN.
>>LET'S DO IT.>>  Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
