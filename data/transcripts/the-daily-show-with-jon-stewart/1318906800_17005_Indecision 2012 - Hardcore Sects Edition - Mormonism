ARE WE READY FOR A MORMON
PRESIDENT OR SHOULD MAINSTREAM
REPUBLICAN CRISTIANS STILL BE
SUSPICIOUS.
FOR MORE WE GO TO SAMANTHA BEE
AND WYATT CENAC.
NICE TO SEE YOU GUYS.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
LET ME JUST START HERE.
WYATT.
>> WAIT.
>> Jon: I'M GOING THE START
WITH WYATT.
>> JUST A SECOND HERE.
WHY IS WYATT TEAM NORMAL?
OKAY.
THAT IMPLIES THAT MORMONS
AREN'T NORMAL.
>> PLEASE, IT'S JUST
SEMANTICS.
I'M NOT SITTING HERE
COMPLAINING THAT YOUR SHIRT
DOESN'T SAY TEAM TEAM CULT ON
IT.
>> WE ARE NOT A CULT.
MORMONISM IS A PROUD RELIGION
FOUNDED BY A GREAT MAN WHO WAS
GUIDED BY THE ANGEL MORONI TO
GOLDEN PLATES BURIED IN
UPSTATE NEW YORK THAT HE
PLACED IN A BOTTOM OF A HAT
WHERE HE READ THEM USING A
SEEER STONE.
RIGHT.
FROM THE GUY WHO BELIEVES THAT
JESUS COULD WALK ON WATER AND
HEAL THE SICK WITH HIS MAGIC
FINGERS.
>> YES.
BUT MORMONS BELIEVE THAT TOO.
>> OH, SHEEP WHISKERS.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> OF COURSE I'M RIGHT.
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW THAT JESUS
WAS BORN IN BETHLEHEM AFTER
BEING CONCEIVED BY THE VIRGIN
MARY AND THE HOLY GHOST.
>> THAT IS JUST COMMON SENSE.
>> ACTUALLY NOT EVERYBODY....
>> WE ALL AGREE THAT HE ROSE
FROM THE DEAD AND ASCEND TO
HEAVEN.
>> YES.
AND THEN HE RETURNED TO
MISSOURI.
>> CULT.
THAT'S CULTISH.
THAT'S CULT.
>> Jon: I THINK I HAVE FOUND
THE PROBLEM HERE.
NEITHER OF YOU HAS AN ISSUE
SUSPENDING YOUR DISBELIEF
ABOUT ANY OF THE STORIES IN
THE NEW TESTAMENT.
WYATT, YOU SEEM THROWN OFF BY
SOME OF THE MORE ECCENTRIC
TWEAKS THAT MORMONS HAS MADE
TO THE STORY.
>> LOOK WHO'S TALKING.
THE GUY WHOSE PEOPLE THINK
IT'S NORMAL TO HANG OUT IN
SOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM AND
WATCH A GUY WITH A BEARD CUT
OFF A BABY'S PENIS WHILE
EVERYONE EATS POUND CAKE.
WOO-HOO.
>> I HAVE A BEARD AND I
WOULDN'T LET ME....
>> NO.
>> Jon: IN MY DEFENSE, IT'S
JUST THE TIP.
AND THE CAKE IS IS INCORRODE I
BELIEVEY MOIST.
... IS INCREDIBLY MOIST.
BESIDES THE POINT.
WHAT WE WANT TO GET TO IS
SIMPLY THIS.
WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH WITH
THE MORMON THING HERE?
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GUYS AGREE
ON THE BASICS.
>> MAGIC UNDERWEAR.
>> Jon: I REALIZE MORMONS
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO SWEAR.
IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN COME
UP WITH.
>> I'M TOO EXHAUSTED SINCE I
CAN'T DRINK (BEEP) COFFEE,
OKAY.
>> YOU SWORE.
>> BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS YOU
SUCKING MOTHER....
>> Jon: GUYS, CALM DOWN.
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS
SHOULD BEING MORMON DISQUALIFY
YOU FROM THE PRESIDENCY?
I MEAN, YOU BOTH BELIEVE IN
JESUS, RIGHT?
>> YES.
>> YES.
>> Jon: AS LONG AS A
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE BELIEVES
IN THE BASIC TENETS, I AM THE
WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE.
NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER
EXCEPT THROUGH ME.
>> THAT IS A GOOD ONE.
>> Jon: LET THE ONE AMONGST
YOU WHO IS WITHOUT SIN BE THE
FIRST TO CAST THE STONE.
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> WE ARE FIGHTING ABOUT THE
SILLY PROBLEM.
>> Jon: IF YOU WANT TO BE
PERFECT GO SELL YOUR
POSSESSIONS AND GIVE TO THE
POOR.
YOU WILL TREASURE IN HEAVEN.
>> OKAY.
>> Jon: THE MAN WITH TWO
TUNICS SHOULD SHARE WITH ME
WHO HAS NONE AND THE ONE WHO
HAS FOOD SHOULD DO THE SAME.
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> NO, NO, NO.
WHAT KIND OF OCCUPY WALL
STREET (BEEP) IS THAT?
>> I'M PRETTY SURE THAT JESUS
WAS A FREE MARKET GUY.
>> Jon: I'M JUST QUOTING
SCRIPTURE.
>> AHA.
>>
