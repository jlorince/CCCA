PROGRAM.
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT WE
TALK A LOT ABOUT FOX NEWS
NETWORK ON THIS SHOW FOR TWO
REASONS.
FIRST, THEY'RE TERRIBLE.
SECOND, SECOND, SECOND,
THEY'RE THE BEST.
IN CABLE NEWS FOX KICKS
EVERYONE ELSE'S ASS.
HIGHER RATINGS, STRONGER
PERSONALITIES.
MOST IMPORTANT A CLEAR SENSE
OF PURPOSE FOR THE BRAND THAT
EVERYONE KNOWS.
FAIR AND BALANCEDED.
THE NETWORK'S ESSENCE
DISSTILLED INTO A SINGLE
PHRASE CLEARLY CONVEYING THE
MESSAGE YOUR SOURCE FOR HYPER
PARTISAN (BEEP): IT'S GREAT
BRANDING WAY BETTER THAN CNN'S,
IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS YOUR
FLIGHT HAS BEEN CANCELED.
THAT ONE LANDED.
MS-NBC HAS LAUNCHED A BOLD NEW
AD CAMPAIGN OF THEIR OWN.
>> NO MATTER WHO OR WHERE THEY
COME FROM.
(LAUGHING).
>> Jon: ARE YOU SURE YOUR TAG
LINE SHOULDN'T BE SQUINT TO
AVOID SEIZURES?
WELL, MAYBE THE PRINT ADS WILL
HELP US UNDERSTAND.
THERE'S RACHAEL MADDO YOU.
SHE'S LEANING FORWARD I GUESS
APPARENTLY HAVING DROPPED
SOMETHING.
AND THERE'S KEITH OBERMAN
LEANING BACKWARDS.
IS IT REALLY THIS HARD?
I DON'T THINK I'M
UNDERSTANDING.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE BRINGING
AGAINST FOX.
GOOD LUCK.
IT'S LIKE WHEN NIKE CAME OUT
WITH "JUST DO IT."
REEBOK ANSWERS WITH THIS.
IT'S JUST LAME.
IT DOESN'T... UNLESS I'M...
I'M TELLING YOU.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WOULD BE A
BAD SIGN IF YOU UNVEIL A NEW
PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN AND THE
PRESIDENT OF YOUR NETWORK HAS
TO COME OUT MAKING A VIDEO
EXPLAINING IT.
>> LEAN FORWARD IS THE
SENSIBILITY.
AS A SENSIBILITY THERE ALREADY
EXISTS.
NOW WE'RE JUST PUTTING THIS
NAME TO IT.
THAT'S WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT.
ALWAYS CHANGING FOR THE
BETTER.
THAT'S OUR SENSIBILITY.
LOOK FOR THAT.
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOW.
THAT'S WHAT WE PROMOTE ON THIS
NETWORK.
>> Jon: AMERICA CHANGING FOR
THE BETTER.
BY THE WAY IS THAT CNN ON IN
THE BACKGROUND OF YOUR...
(LAUGHING).
I GUESS YOU WERE AT THE
AIRPORT.
BY THE WAY, IS THAT MS-NBC
ABOUT AMERICA ALWAYS CHANGING
FOR THE BETTER THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE PROMOTING ON YOUR
NETWORK.
HAVE YOU TOLD YOUR STAFF THAT?
>> THINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE
NOW THAN BARACK OBAMA COULD
HAVE EVER IMAGINED.
>> UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS
COUNTRY IS IS REALLY BAD.
>> PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES ARE
HIGHER THIS YEAR THAN LAST
YEAR.
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS
FALLEN FROM FIRST TO 12th IN
COLLEGE COMPLETION RATES.
>> OUR GULF COAST HAS BEEN
CHANGED FOR A GENERATION.
>> WHAT A HORROR THIS
GENERATION IS LEAVING FOR ONES
TO COME.
>> Jon: DON'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT TOMORROW.
DON'T STOP.
IT WILL SOON
