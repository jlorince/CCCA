COMEDY CENTRAL
>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GREAT SHOW FOR TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, ALAN HUFFMAN
AN HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT
THE DARK SIDE OF AMERICAN
POLITICS OR AS IT IS SOMETIMES
KNOWN, AMERICAN POLITICS.
LET'S BEGIN WITH THE BATTLE
BETWEEN RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OVER
CONTRACEPTION IN OUR ONGOING
COVERAGE OF THE NANNY STATE.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T
BEEN FOLLOWING THE STORY, LET
ME BRING YOU UP TO SPEED.
YEARS AGO ADAM AND EVE LIVED
IN A GARDEN.
LET'S JUST SCROLL UP.
OKAY, OKAY.
MARTIN LUTHER NAILED 95
THESIS.
LET'S SCROLL UP.
OKAY.
HERE WE GO.
TWO WEEKS AGO THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION FOUND ITSELF AT
THE CENTER OF A CONTROVERSY
OVER ITS DECISIONS TO MAKE
RELIGIOUS AFFILIATED
INSTITUTIONS OR THEIR INSURERS
COVER CONTRACEPTION AS PART OF
THEIR GOVERNMENT-MANDATED
HEALTH CARE.
THE MOVE WAS SEEN BY SOME
RELIGIOUS LEADERS AS BAL'S
BIGGEST MISSTEP SINCE THE TIME
HE SET ASIDE A CHAIR FOR
ELIJAH WOOD AT THE PASSOVER
SEDER.
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ORTHODOX
JEWS THAT REALLY GOT THAT.
EVERYONE ELSE DOES NOT
UNDERSTAND.
SO WE HAVE OURSELVES AN OLD-
FASHIONED LIBERTY STAND OFF.
ON THE ONE HAND THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH.
THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE FORCED
TO PAY MONEY FOR INSURANCE
PLANS FOR CONTRACEPTION FOR
EVEN THEIR NON-CATHOLIC
EMPLOYEES ALTHOUGH THEY DO PAY
THOSE EMPLOYEES MONEY.
THE ARGUMENT COULD BE PAID BY
PAYING CHURCH MONEY, IS USED
FOR ENTRANCE FEES TO CLUBS OR
CATS TO HAVE SEX WITH DOGS.
ACE STREET AND THIRD AVENUE.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
ON THE OTHER HAND, BIG
BUSINESS.
ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE WOMEN
WHO FOR SOME REASON WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE
COSTS PROVIDED BY THEIR HEALTH
CARE INSURANCE PROVIDER.
TOUGH CASE BECAUSE THE SIDES
ARE THE CATHOLICS AND WOMEN.
BOTH ARE INFALLIBLE.
AM I RIGHT?
SO LAST THURSDAY CONGRESSMAN
DARRELL ISSA CONVENED A PANEL
THAT SETTLED THE ISSUE.
WHILE NO LADIES WERE ACTUALLY
ALLOWED TO SPEAK UNTIL THE
AFTERNOON SESSION AND NO
LADIES ACTUALLY EVER SPOKE ON
BEHALF OF LADIES, SOME OF
THESE FELLOWS WERE WEARING
GOWNS.
SO THAT'S SOMETHING.
LET'S HEAR THE TONE THAT THE
SAUSAGEFEST STRUCK IN THIS
EFFORT TO FIND BALANCE BETWEEN
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE
REALITIES OF THE SECULAR
WORLD.
>> I DON'T NORMALLY QUOTE FROM
JOSEPH STALIN.
>> Jon: I'M GOING TO STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.
WE'LL JUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
GUY IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
ANYONE HAVE A SLIGHTLY LESS
HYPERBOLIC TAKE ON THIS?
>> THE VIOLATION OF A PERSON'S
RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE WAS
NOTHING LESS THAN THE RAPE OF
THE SOUL.
>> Jon: THAT'S A QUOTE FROM
ROGER WILLIAMS AND I BELIEVE
THE WORST LAW AND ORDER SPIN-OFF
YET.
LISTEN.
NO ONE LOVES THEIR=
PLAN, BUT SOUL RAPE?
YOU MAY NOT REALIZE THIS BUT
CATHOLIC CHURCH ALREADY OFFERS
HEALTH PLANS THAT COVER
VIAGRA.
A.K.A., FOUR-HOUR JOHNSON
JUICE.
I'M GUESSING THAT THAT DOESN'T
RAPE THE SOUL.
SOME OF YOUR EMPLOYEE IZ GUESS
ARE GETTING THAT SUBSIDIZED
VIE AGO A AND SOME OF THEM ARE
SINGLE UNMARRIED MEN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
DOING WITH THEIR ERECTION?
SERIOUSLY WE'D LOVE TO KNOW.
SEND YOUR RESPONSES TO BRIAN
WILLIAMS CARE OF... (
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
SO HOW IS IT THAT... I CAN'T
WAIT TO FIND OUT.
HOW IS IT THAT WOMEN CAN'T GET
THEIR PILL BUT MEN CAN GET
THEIR PILL?
AS IT HAPPENS THE CHURCH
ANSWERED THAT VERY QUESTION 12
YEARS AGO.
>> VIE AGO A ACTUALLY ANSWERS
A MEDICAL PROBLEM.
CONTRACEPTION IS A CHOICE THAT
SOMEBODY MAY MAKE, BUT IT
DOESN'T ANSWER A PARTICULAR
HEALTH CARE NEED.
>> Jon: TWO THINGS, WHY ONE
DOES 12 YEARS AGO LOOK LIKE
THE '70s ON TELEVISION?
HAVE WE REALLY ADVANCED THAT
FAR IN 12 YEARS?
TWO, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SAYS
A MAN IS IN NEED BUT NOT
GETTING PREGNANT IS MORE OF A
WANT.
BY THE WAY WHILE I WAS
SURPRISED THAT THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH IS PRO MEDICALLY
INDUCED BONERS I WAS MORE
SHOCKED AT THE AD IT RAN TO
SHOW ITS SUPPORT.
NOW, YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THE
SPIRIT WILL MOVE YOU.Q,:Ã±M
ANYWAY, I DIGRESS.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY BOTH GET
TO WEAR THAT.
BACK TO HEARING.
WE'VE ALREADY HER FROM THE
STALIN AND RAPIST PEOPLE.
COULD SOMEONE PUT THIS IN
TERMS THAT ARE MORE
RELATEABLE.
>> FOR MY TESTIMONY TODAY, I
WOULD LIKE TO TELL A STORY.
LET'S CALL IT THE PARABLE OF
THE KOSHER DELI.
>> Jon: GO ON.
>> ONCE UPON A TIME A NEW LAW
WAS PROPOSED SO THAT ANY
BUSINESS THAT SERVES FOOD MUST
SERVE PORK.
CAN A CUSTOMER COME TO A
KOSHER DELI, DEMAND TO BE
SERVED A HAM SANDWICH, AND IF
REFUSED BRING DOWN SEVERE
GOVERNMENT SANCTION ON THE
DELI?
A NATION COMMITTED TO
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND
DIVERSITY, THE ANSWER IS NO.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: DO YOU GOT MY PEOPLE?
SO YOUR PAR ABLE ABOUT THE
KOSHER DELI, WHILE DELICIOUS,
MAKES NO (BEEP) SENSE.
NOBODY IS FORCING THE KOSHER
DELI OWNER TO SERVE A HAM.
IN THE METAPHOR IT'S MORE LIKE
THE OWNER OF THE KOSHER DELI
IS REFUSING TO PAY TAXES
BECAUSE HIS MONEY COULD GO TO
FOOD STAMPS WHICH SOMEONE
MIGHT THEORETICALLY USE TO BUY
HAM.
TO BE FAIR TO DARRELL ISSA AT
THE HEARINGS A WOMAN WAS PUT
FORTH TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF
SOMEONE WHO NEEDED
CONTRACEPTION.
