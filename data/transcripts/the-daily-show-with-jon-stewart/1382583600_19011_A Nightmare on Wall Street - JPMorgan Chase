THE PASSION AND DRIVE FROM SOMANY CNBC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSTS
GOES SOLELY IN ONE DIRECTION ANDNOT IN THE DIRECTION YOU
NORMALLY ASSOCIATE WITHJOURNALISM.
HERE IS MARIA REACTING TO ALEXPAREENE'S INCREDIBLE HUBRIS
>> I THINK ANY TIME YOU ARELOOKING AT THE GREATEST FINE IN
THE HISTORY OF WALLSTREET REGULATION
IT'S WORTH ASKING SHOULDTHIS GUY STAY IN HIS JOB.
>> THE COMPANY CONTINUES TOCHURN OUT TENS OF BILLIONS IN
EARNING AND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONSIN REVENUE, HOW DO YOU CRITICIZE
THAT?
>> Jon: BECAUSE PROFIT IS THEONLY WAY WE JUDGE THINGS.
ONLY AT CNBC IS BREAKING BAD THESTORY HOW ONE MAN THROUGH HARD
STORWORK AND SMART BUSINESSARDPRACTICES
SLOWLY INSULATES HIMSELF FROMCRITICISM WATCH AS THE INTREPID
YOUNG PAREENE SUGGESTSTHERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS OF
LOOKING AT MORGAN CHASE.
>> A LOT OF EARNINGS ANDREVENUE WE'VE SEEN HAVE
COME FROM SHADY DEALINGS.
>> COME ON.
>> IT'S A FACT.
IT'S IN THE NEWS.
>> WHAT IS THE FACT?
>> THEY HIRED OF CHILDREN OFPROMINENT PARTY OFFICIALS AND
THERE'S A SPREAD SHEET WHICHCONNECTED TO DEALS THEY WERE
TRYING TO DO IN CHINA.
>> I DON'T LIKE HEARING THINGSTHAT ARE NOT FACTS ON THIS
PROGRAM.
>> ANYBODY CAN GOOGLE CHINA ANDJP MORGAN.
IT WAS IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES".
>> OH, "THE NEW YORK TIMES", OH,OKAY.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: OH, "THE NEW YORK
TIMES", THE PAPER OF RECORD FORCRACKHEADS AND LIARS.
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY FINANCIALJOURNALISTS SEEM TO FEEL THAT
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTINGIS BENEATH THEIR VERACITY
STANDARDS.
IS THERE A NEW SOURCE THAT ISFACT-FILLED AND TRUSTWORTHY
ENOUGH TO QUOTE ON YOUR HALLOWEDCNBC AIR.
>> MANDATORY READING THEEDITORIAL IN THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL.
>> WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEEDITORIAL IN THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL.
>> SHAKEDOWN SAYS "THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL".
>> IF YOU YOU HAVE TO WORK ATTHE EDITORIAL BOARD YOU MIGHT AS
WELL BE AT THE "NEW YORK TIMES".
>> THE ONLY PLACE THE FINANCIALGUYS CONSIDER FACTUAL ENOUGH FOR
REBROADCAST IS THE ONE PART OFTHE RUPERT MURDOCH BIAS MACHINE
EXPLICITLY LABELED OPINION.
THERE MAY BE ONE MITIGATINGFACTOR IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES
MORGAN FOUND THEMSELVES IN WHENTAKING ON THE LIABILITIES OF
WASHINGTON MUTUAL AND BEARSTERNS.
>> THE GOVERNMENT ASKED JPMORGAN BUY UP BEAR STERNS AND
BUY WASHINGTON MUTUAL.
>> THEY CAME TO JPM HAT IN HANDIN ORDER TO SAVE THEM FROM
COLLAPSE.
>> THEY BEGGED HIM TO DO IT.
HE COULD HAVE WALKED AWAY.
>> WAMU AND BEAR STERNS.
>> THE GOVERNMENT DID PUT A GUNTO THEIR HEAD.
THEY WERE VIGOROUSLY ENCOURAGEDTO TAKE OVER BEAR STERNS.
>> Jon: OH, I DID NOT REALIZETHAT.
I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THEGOVERNMENT PUT A GUN TO HIS
HEAD, FORCED HIM INTO A BADDEAL.
NOW I GET YOUR OUTRAGE.
I'M SORRY.
IF ONLY THERE WAS A WAY TO GOBACK IN TIME TO WHEN THAT DEAL
WAS CONSUMATED IN 2008 AND SEEHOW OUTRAGED CNBC WAS FOR JP
MORGAN AT THAT TIME AS THEGOVERNMENT FORCED DIMON TO
SWALLOW THIS (bleep) SANDWICH.
[ LAUGHTER ]AND I WONDER IF THE INDIVIDUAL
WHO COULD GIVE US A SENSE OFTHAT DEAL WAS AN OLD FRIEND WHO
DOESN'T SEEM TO REALIZE HISSHOWS ARE TAPED AND BROADCAST.
SO MUCH THE BETTER.
THERE'S NO WORD IN THE ENGLISHLANGUAGE THAT CAPTURES THE
THE RUTHLESS BRILLIANCE OF WHATJAMIE DIMON, THE CEO OF JP
MORGAN ACCOMPLISHED THISWEEKEND.
>> Jon: GO ON.
>> DIMON MASTERMINDED ADEAL THAT IS AMAZING FOR JP
MORGAN AND MAKES ME WANT TO SAYBUY BUY BUY.
HE TOTALLY OUTFOXED THE FED.
THERE'S NO DENYING IT WAS ASTEAL.
MAYBE A SHAKEDOWN IF THE LEGALDEPARTMENT WOULD LET ME. IT'SL
PRACTICALLY CRIMINAL, AND I MEAN IT AS A POSITIVE.
IT'S THE HENRY POTTER PRIZE FORMERCILESS TAKE NO PRISONERS BUT
LOTS OF PROFITS BANKING.
[LAUGHTER][BLEEP] ALL Y'ALL
