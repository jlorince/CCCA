DOESN'T PLAY BY THE RULES AND
ROGER AISLES WILL NOT LET ME.
WE'RE JOINED BY SAMANTHA BEE
LIVE FROM DES MOINES, IOWA.
THANKS FOR JOINING ME.
I KNOW GOVERNOR PALIN SAYS IT'S
A FAMILY VACATION.
IT DOES SEEM LIKE A POLITICAL
CAMPAIGN.
HOW CAN SHE DO THIS AND KEEP HER
JOB AS A FOX NEWS ANALYST?
>> JON, FOR FOX TO FIRE SARAH
PALIN FOR TAKING A MUCH NEEDED
VACATION WITH THE FAMILY THAT
WOULD BE MONSTROUS.
I THEY THAT'S HOW YOU RUN YOUR
BUSINESS BUT SOME FAKE NEWS
ORGANIZATIONS ACTUALLY HAVE
STANDARDS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: ANYONE ELSE WHO HOPPED
ON A BUS AND WENT TO IOWA AND
ALL THESE OTHER SWING STATE AND
THINGS, HISTORICAL LANDMARKS
WOULD BE FORCED TO DECLARE
WHETHER THEY ARE RUNNING OR NOT.
GINGRICH, SANTORUM LOST THEIR
JOB FOR DOING JUST THAT.
FOX HAS DIFFERENT RULES FOR
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
>> THEY HAVE THE SAME RULE FOR
HE EVERYBODY.
IF WE LIKE YOU, YOU CAN STAY.
THEY FIRED RICK SANTORUM WHEN
THEY GOOGLED HIM.
[LAUGHTER]
AS FOR NEWT GINGRICH, THE
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WAS REALLY
JUST A GOOD EXCUSE TO LET HIM
GO.
WHAT NEWS NETWORK WANTS TO
EMPLOY AN ANGRY OLD BABY?
IT'S NOT 60 MINUTES, YOU KNOW?
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: FAIR ENOUGH.
HE DOES LOOK LIKE A GIANT ANGRY
BABY.
IT SEEMS UNFAIR THAT SARAH PALIN
GETS TO PRETEND LIKE SHE'S BOTH
RUNNING AND NOT RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT DEPENDING ON WHAT IS
MOST HELPFUL.
>> SHE'S A MAVERICK.
SHE MAKES HER OWN RULES.
CAN'T A LONE WOLF MAMA GRIZZLY
FORM A PAC, GO ON TOUR AND TALK
TO VOTERS ABOUT HER VISION FOR
AMERICA WITHOUT HAVING TO GIVE
UP HER SEVEN FIGURE TELEVISION
JOB AT A PLACE THAT TREATS HER
AS SOME SORT OF CONSERVATIVE
DEMI GOING.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH US?
>> Jon: HOW LONG IS THIS
FAMILY VACATION SCHEDULED FOR
ANYWAY?
>> THEIR LAST STOP IS IN JANUARY
2013.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: THAT COINCIDES WITH
THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION
FOR PRESIDENT.
>> NO IT JUST SAYS PI D.C.
>> Jon: IT'S PRESIDENTIAL
INAUGURATION, DC.
SHE'S RUN.
>> SHE'S NOT RUNNING [MUSIC
PLAYING]
>> SOUNDS LIKE THE SPWUS ABOUT
TO LEAVEEL.
I BETTER SCA DATEL.
>> Jon: HER BUS HORN PLAYS
HAIL TO THE CHIEF.
>> NO, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S
WHEELS ON THE BUS.
THE WHILES ON THE BUS THEY
