BUT FOR MIDDLE EAST WATCHERS, THE BIGGEST NEWS WAS THE PARTICIPATION OF IRANIAN
PRESIDENT MAHMOUD AHMADINEJAD THE FIRST TIME AN IRANIAN HEAD OF STATE VISITED EGYPT IN MORE
THAN 30 YEARS.
>> FOR MORP THAN THREE DECADES THEY STAYED AWAY.
MANY EXPECT A CORDIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IRAN AND EGYPT BUT NOT ONE WHERE THEY ARE
BEST FRIENDS.
>> Jon: THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE BESTIES.
FRIEND OF A FRIEND LIKE A FRIEND'S COLLEGE ROOMMATE.
YOU ARE COOL WITH EACH OTHER EXCEPT YOU LIKE THE EAGLE AND HE LIKE THE GIANTS EXCEPT REPLACE
THE EAGLES WITH YOU BELIEVE IN THE HOLOCAUST -- BLESS YOU WIKIPEDIA.
NOT EVERYONE IN EGYPT FEELS THE SAME WAY WITH THE IRANIAN LEADER.
>> A PROTESTER THREW HIS SHOE AT AHMADINEJAD.
>> THE SHOE DIDN'T CONNECT.
IT HIT A SECURITY GUARD.
>> THAT SECURITY GUARD, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED NOW HAS ATHLETE'S FACE.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, I IMAGINE THAT THROWING YOUR SHOE AT A LEADER IS NOT AN EASY CRIME TO GET AWAY WITH.
WHO THREW THAT?
AHHH --
[LAUGHTER]
CLEARLY THIS CONFERENCE DESERVES THE ATTENTION, IF NOT THE WORLD, AT LEAST BASIC CABLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO JOHN OLIVER SAT DOWN WITH IOC GENERAL IHSANOGLU TO LEARN MOW.
>> YESTERDAY I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE OIC,
THE MAN WHO HAS THE EAR OF EVERY HEAD OF STATE IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND BEYOND.
WHAT PAY CHANCE TO UNDERSTAND THE SUBTLE INTERCASEYS OF ENTIRE MUSLIM WORLD.
CONGRATULATIONS OF YOUR RECENT SUMMIT.
>> THANK YOU.
IT WENT VERY WELL.
>> YOU SERVE AS THE VOICE OF ISLAMIC COUNTRIES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S BY THE VIRTUE OF THE CHARTER.
>> WHAT DOES THAT VOICE SOUND LIKE?
DOES IT SOUND LIKE AHH I'M GOING TO (bleep) KILL YOU.
AHHH.
I'M GOING TO KILL YOUR FAMILY?
ARRGH?
BECAUSE OCCASIONALLY THAT IS HOW IT REQUEST COME ACROSS TO US.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WELL, THE VOICE WHICH YOU KINDLY IMITATED IS A VOICE OF MARGINAL GROUPS BUT THE VOICE OF
MASSES, THE VOICE OF ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE IS THE VOICE OF MODERATION.
>> IT WAS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR AMERICA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MUSLIM
WORLD AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO START THAN WITH BRUTAL HONESTY.
HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH AMERICA AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
OKAY?
WE TRIED EVERYTHING.
WE TRIED SPECIAL ENVOYS.
WE'VE TRIED INTERVENTIONS, WE'VE TRIED WARS.
WE'VE TRIED GIVING YOU MONEY, NOT GIVING YOU MONEY.
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ISLAMIC WORLD WANTS FROM AMERICA.
IT'S LITERALLY NEVER OCCURRED TO US TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION BEFORE.
>> TAKE THE PROBLEM OF TERRORISM.
IF YOU THINK THAT KILLING TERRORISTS ARE THE SOLUTION TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF TERRORISM,
THEY THEN WE ARE THE PROBLEM.
>> THAT MIGHT BE WHAT WE THINK.
>> WHEN YOU KILL ONE TERRORIST YOU BREED TEN TERRORISTS.
>> RIGHT SOMETIMES IT FEELS A BIT LIKE WHACK A MOLE.
YOU WHACK ONE ANOTHER ONE TURNS UP SOMEWHERE ELSE.
THEY ARE IN IRAQ, WHACK, NOW THEY ARE IN SYRIA, WHACK.
NOW THEY ARE IN MALLEY.
WHERE IS MALI?
>> THERE'S A NEED TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE OUTLOOK AND TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS AND THE
SHORT HISTORY OF USING THE WRONGS AGAINST TERRORISTS.
THERE'S BEEN CERTAIN MEASURED MISTAKES BY KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIAN PEOPLE.
>> PEOPLE DON'T WANT THE DRONES THEN?
>> YOU HAVE TO CARE FOR THE LEGAL ETHICS, IT'S NOT ONLY THAT YOUR PUSHING YOUR OWN NATIONAL INTERESTS.
>> IT'S CLEAR HUMAN RIGHTS INFRACTION AND IT HAS TO STOP.
>> SO NO DRONES.
OF COURSE.
EVERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP HAS TO BE BASED ON AN ABILITY TO LISTEN TO ONE ANOTHER.
>> THIS IS WHERE WE AS OIC ARE TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THE WHOLE WORLD THAT WE NEED TO HAVE OPEN
COMMUNICATIONS CHANNELS TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.
>> OKAY, SO THIS IS A PEACE PILLOW.
OKAY?
NOW, WHENEVER SOMEBODY IS HOLDING THIS IT'S A SAFE SPACE AND THEY GET TO SAY WHAT THEY
LIKE ABOUT THE OTHER CULTURE.
OKAY.
I'LL GO FIRST.
WE SOMETIMES FIND YOU FRUSTRATING BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU BLAME US FOR THINGS THAT
HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO AND YOU'VE GOT LONG MEMORIES AND YOU REMEMBER TOO MANY THINGS.
OKAY, SO NOW YOU GO.
>> WELL, I THINK THE MUSLIM WORLD IS FRUSTRATED SOMETIMES WITH THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE
IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS OF THE MUSLIM WORLD.
THE IMAGE OF THE UNITED STATES INVADING IRAQ, ININVITEDDING AFGHANISTAN, ET CETERA.
>> ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
>> I WANT TO MAKE REFERENCE TO TWO THINGS.
IN THE FIRST WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS FIRST INTEGRATED I PROBABLY --
>> OKAY, OKAY.
>> I HAVE THE PILLOW, PLEASE ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS THE BEST IDEAS AND EXPECTATIONS AND WE HOPE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS --
>> YOU CAN BE VERY ANNOYING BECAUSE WE FIND IT HARD TO READ YOU AND YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO US
AS WELL BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN MUCH.
AFTER HOURS OF INTENSE DISCUSSION FINALLY A BREAKTHROUGH.
WE FOUND THE ONE AREA THAT WOULD FIX IFERG INSTANTLY.
>> ONE IMPORTANT IDEA.
THIS IS THE ISSUE OF MUSLIM WORLD.
THE PALESTINIAN ISSUE NEED IT'S BE SOLVED.
THIS IS REALLY THE MOST SENSITIVE ISSUE THAT NEEDS THE CARE OF THE ADMINISTRATION.
>> THAT IS GREAT.
SO ALL WE HAVE TO DO TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ISLAMIC WORLD IS SOLVE THE ARAB ISRAELI CONFLICT.
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION.
>> WE HAD DONE IT AND NOW TOLL SEAL OUR HISTORIC AGREEMENT IN THE TRADITIONAL MANNER AND THEN BANG.
BANG, UP TOP.
POUND IT OUT.
AND BLOW IT UP.
>> THANK YOU.
>> MAYBE NOT THE UM, OTHERWISE WE'RE GOOD.
HASEL TOF.
>> MY PLEASURE.
>> Jon: JOHN
