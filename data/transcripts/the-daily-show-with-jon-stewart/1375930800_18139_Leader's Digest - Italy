>> John: NAILED IT!
ANOTHER LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR
NEXT COUNTRY.
AND WHO IS IT?
YES.
ITALY!
THE COUNTRY'S BEEN GRAPPLING
WITH TWO PROBLEMS RECENTLY, A
SPHIERALLING ECONOMY AND WHAT TO
DO WITH THE FORMER LEADER WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.
>> THE ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER IS
NO STRANGER TO SCANDAL.
>> CHARGES OF BRIBERY,
CORRUPTION, TAX FRAUD, AND
EMBEZZLEMENT.
>> TALES OF LAVISH ORNLIES.
>> NIGHT OF BONGA-BONGA PARTIES.
>> OH, YES, BERLUSCONI, A
ONE-MAN CHEMICALLY INDUCED
BONER.
LAST YEAR, THE REAL-LIFE LEATHER
FACE WAS CONVICTED OF TAX FRAUD,
BUT WE KNOW HISTORICALLY JUST
BECAUSE HE'S CONVICTED OF
SOMETHING, BY NO MEANS, MEANS
THAT HE'S GOING TO JAIL.
IN THE PAST, HE'S BEEN CHARGED
WITH BRIBERY, TAX FRAUD, ABUSE
OF OFFICE, AND SEX WITH AN
UNDERAGED PROSTITUTE, JUST TO
NAME A FEW, AND HE STILL HAS NOT
GONE TO JAIL SO THE INEXPLICABLE
ACQUITTAL SHOULD BE COMING
REQUEST MOMENT NOW.
>> COUNTRY'S SUPREME COURT
UPHELD THE FORMER PRIME
MINISTER'S FOUR-YEAR PRISON
SENTENCE ON THURSDAY.
>> John: THEY UPHELD IT?
( LAUGHTER )
REALLY?
SO AFTER ALL THE OTHER CRAP HE'S
PULLED, THEY'RE LOCKING HIM UP
FOR TAX FRAUD?
THAT'S LIKE PUTTING DARMA AWAY
FOR FAILING A KITCHEN HEALTH
INSPECTION.
DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT TOO MUCH.
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR LUCK HAS
FINALLY RUN OUT, SILVIO.
YOU'LL BE TRAINING IN THE
PINSTRIPES FOR PRISON STREEPS.
>> HE'S LIKELY GOING TO BE
PERFORMING COMMUNITY SERVICE OR
HAVE TO LIVE UNDER HOUSE ARREST.
>> HOUSE ARREST, BY THE WAY, IN
THE VAIL, SEASIDE ESTATE, OR THE
PILATSO IN ROME.
>> John: ANOTHER NOT SO MUCH
HOUSE ARREST AS MANSION ARREST.
THEY MUST HAVE FELT HOUSE ARREST
IS JUST AS GOOD AS PRISON WHEN
YOUR PALAZZO IS ACTUALLY THE
SIZE OF AN ACTUAL PRISON.
SO HE'S NOT GOING TO JAIL.
SURELY HIS POLITICAL CAREER IS
AT LOWEST OVER.
>> A LOWER COURT HAD BANNED HIM
FROM HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICE FOR
FIVE YEARS.
THAT WAS LOWERED TO THREE.
>> PUBLIC PROSECUTOR HAD
SUGGESTED THAT THAN REDUCED TO A
THREE-MONTH BAN.
>> John: A THREE-MONTH BAN.
ON POLITICS.
THAT'S NOT A SENTENCE.
THAT'S A VACATION.
YOU KNOW WHO I FEEL SORRY FOR IN
ALL OF THIS EYENT CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING-- THIS ASIDE FROM THE
ACTUAL VICTIMS OF BERLUSCONI'S
CRIME, I ACTUALLY FEEL BAD FOR
ANTHONY WEINER MEAN DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE SEX WITH ANYONE WHEN HIS
CAREER IS OVER WITHOUT EVEN A
