>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD NUN FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
TONIGHT'S GUEST GROVER NOR
QUIST.
MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BE SO
EXCITED THAT I GOT TO
INTERVIEW GROVER.
I'M ASSUMING I'M THINKING OF
THE RIGHT PERSON.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE
INTERNET.
THAT MAGICAL SERIES OF TUBES
THAT AL GORE INVENTED SO HE'D
NEVER HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE
TO GET PORN.
IT'S TRUE.
ANYWAY, TWEETS AND HASH TAGS
ABOUT THIS NEW VIRAL SENSATION
KONY TRENDING ALL WEEK.
RIHANNA TALKING ABOUT HIM.
SEACREST, THE BEEBS, THIS GUY
KONY IS PROBABLY DROPPING SOME
THICK BEEF, JOE.
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
>> FOR 26 YEARS KONY HAS BEEN
KIDNAPPING CHILDREN INTO HIS
REBEL GROUPS, THE L.R.A.
TURNING THE GIRLS INTO SEX
SLAVES AND THE BOYS INTO CHILD
SOLDIERS.
(LAUGHING)
>> Jon: WOW.
WOW.
THAT SONG SUCKED.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
GET SICK ROLLED.
ANYWAY, IT TURNS OUT THE HOT
NEW VIRAL SENSATION IS A 30-
MINUTE YOU-TUBE DIRECTED BY
JASON RUSSELL CONDEMNING THE
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES OF JOSEPH
KONY, A WAR LORD WHOSE UGANDAN
REBEL GROUP IS INFAMOUS FOR
ITS USE OF CHILD SOLDIERS,
SHOWING SOCIAL MEDIA IS AN
INCREDIBLE SOURCE WHETHER YOU
ARE UNCOVERING AN AWFUL STORY
OR FINDING OUT WHAT YOUR HIGH
SCHOOL FLAME IS UP TO.
HOPEFULLY THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
IN THE SAME SEARCH.
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE,
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT BOY
JOEY YOU WENT TO PROM WITH.
LET'S CHECK IN ON... OH, MY
GOD!
SO A 30-MINUTE VIDEO ON CHILD
WARRIORS IN UGANDA HAS GONE
VIRAL.
HOW POPULAR CAN THIS THING BE?
I'M SURE IT'S NOT TEENAGE GIRL
SINGS SONG ABOUT DAY OF THE
WEEK HOT.
>> IT'S GONE VIRAL.
TENS OF MILLIONS OF VIEWS ON
YOU-TUBE IN JUST A FEW DAYS.
>> 10 MILLION HITS A DAY.
>> UP TO 26 MILLION VIEWS.
>> 39 MILLION HITS AND
COUNTING.
>> 50 MILLION HITS.
>> MORE THAN 57 MILLION.
>> THAT'S RACKED UP MORE THAN
70 MILLION VIEWS.
>> Jon: HOLY CRAP.
THAT IS A HELL OF AN OPEN.
70 MILLION.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF
DISNEY SAW THOSE NUMBERS AND
DID A QUICK JOHN CARTER
REEDIT.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S WHAT KONY GETS FOR
MESSING WITH ALL TIM RIGGINS
HERE.
SOME OF THE MEDIA HAVE
CRITICIZED INVISIBLE CHILDREN,
THE GROUP BEHIND THE VIDEO FOR
FOCUSING THEIR FILM ON RAISING
AWARENESS AMONG AMERICAN YOUTH
AS IF THAT AUTOMATICALLY
TRANSLATED INTO ACTION OR FOR
FACTUAL ISSUES LIKE REPORTING
THAT KONY HAS 30,000 CHILD
SOLDIERS WHEN THAT'S THE TOTAL
NUMBER HE'S INDUCTED BY THE
L.R.A.OVER 30 YEARS.
MAINLY THE MEDIA JUST SEEMS
ANNOYED.
THAT IT TOOK THIS GUY TO GET
PEOPLE TO LISTEN.
>> A LOT MAJOR NEWS
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE TALKED
ABOUT JOSEPH KONY, TALKED
ABOUT THE L.R.A..
>> WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING IT FOR
YEARS.
WE'VE DONE STORY ABOUT IT FOR
YEARS.
I'VE WORKED IN CENTRAL AFRICA
FOR YEARS.
>> SOMEBODY WHO ASKED
PRESIDENT OBAMA ABOUT THIS
LAST OCTOBER AND THERE WAS
VERY LITTLE INTEREST GETTING
THAT QUESTION AND ANSWER OUT
THERE, VERY LITTLE INTEREST OR
AWARENESS BY THE PUBLIC.
>> Jon: I MEAN (BEEP).
WE'RE HANDSOME.
WE'RE ON TV.
WHY WON'T RIHANNA RETREAT OUR
KONY STORY?
IT'S BECAUSE WE STOPPED LISTEN
TO GO THE NEWS MEDIA AROUND
THE SAME TIME YOU HAD PRINCESS
LEIA ON YOUR ELECTION
COVERAGE.
EVEN THOUGH JOHNNY HANDSOME
HAS THE MUSIC AND THE
PRODUCTION VALUE THE VIDEO IS
NOT WITHOUT SOME WEIRDNESS
LIKE WHERE THE DIRECTOR
EXPLAINS THE WAR LORD TO HIS
FIVE-YEAR-OLD SON.
>> JOSEPH KONY HAS AN ARMY.
OKAY?
AND WHAT HE DOES IS HE TAKES
CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS
AND HE GIVES THEM A GUN TO
SHOOT.
HE MAKES THEM SHOOT AND KILL
OTHER PEOPLE.
>> Jon: GOOD NIGHT, SWEETY.
(LAUGHING)
BY THE WAY IF YOU ENJOYED THAT
CLIP, YOU CAN ORDER THE FILM
MAKER'S WHOLE TIME LIFE SERIES
FAMILIES TRAGEDY HORRIBLE
HISTORIES MISS MYSTERIES OF
HUMAN ILLNESS.
IT INCLUDES CLASSICS LIKE
PEOPLE CAN DIE UNEXPECTEDLY
AND FOR NO GOOD REASON.
SOMETIMES YOU'RE AT THE BEACH
AND A GIANT WAVE CAN SWEEP
EVERYBODY AWAY.
THERE ARE GROUPS CALLED
TERRORISTS WHO WANT BOMBS TO
KILL EVERYONE.
