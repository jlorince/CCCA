IS THAT I BELIEVED YOU HELPEDTHE ADMINISTRATION TAKE US TO,
LIKE, THE MOST DEVASTATINGMISTAKE IN FOREIGN POLICY THAT
WE'VE MADE IN, LIKE, 100 YEARS.
BUT YOU SEEM LOVELY.
( LAUGHTER )WHY IS THAT WRONG?
>> THAT'S WHY I WROTE THE BOOK.>> Jon: OKAY.
>> I WROTE THE BOOK BECAUSEI'D HOPED THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU
WOULD READ IT -->> Jon: I DID.
>> AND DETERMINE THAT, ONE, ITWAS REALLY, REALLY HARD TO DO
THIS KIND OF REPORTING.
I WASN'T ALONE.
I HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF COMPANY.
AND THAT THE INTELLIGENCESOURCES THAT WE WERE TALKING TO
HAD REALLY NEVER BEEN WRONGBEFORE.
THESE WERE NOT THE PEOPLE THATYOU HAD ON THE SCREEN, YOU KNOW,
DICK CHENEY AND GEORGE BUSH.
THAT'S NOT WHERE THISINFORMATION CAME FROM.
IT CAME FROM THE MEN AND WOMENWHO HAD STEERED ME RIGHT ON
AL QAEDA BEFORE 9/11.
WHO HAD TOLD ME THAT THE SOVIETUNION, AND THE FORMER SOVIET
UNION HAD A HUGE CACHE OFBIOLOGICAL WEAPONS THAT THEY
HAD NEVER ACKNOWLEDGEDAND THEY WERE RIGHT.
AND THEY HAD NEVER LED MEASTRAY.
AND THEN I WENT BACK TO THEM INTHIS BOOK AND SAID, "WHAT
HAPPENED?
HOW DID YOU GET IT WRONG?
HOW DID I GET IT WRONG?">> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE TRIED TODO IN THIS BOOK.
>> Jon:THERE WAS A MOMENTUMTO TAKE US TO WAR.
SOMETHING TOOK US TO WAR INIRAQ.
WOULD YOU AGREE?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon:  WHAT-- WHAT TOOK USTO WAR IN AFGHANISTAN?
>> 9/11.
>> Jon:  CORRECT.
WHAT TOOK US TO WAR IN IRAQ?
>>I THINK 9/11.
>> Jon:  UH-HUH.
>> IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS IARGUE IN THE BOOK.
>> Jon:  I THINK IT WAS ACONCERTED EFFORT TO TAKE TO US
WAR IN IRAQ.
YOU HAD TO SHIFT WITH ENERGY THEFOCUS OF AMERICA FROM
AFGHANISTAN AND AL QAEDA TOIRAQ.
THAT TOOK EFFORT.
WOULD YOU AGREE?
>> IT TOOK PERSUADING, AND THEYPERSUADED A LOT OF DEMOCRATS,
HILLARY CLINTON, JOHN KERRY.
>> Jon:  TURNS OUT IDIOCY ISBIPARTISAN.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
( APPLAUSE ) >> Jon: SO, SO, THAT'S NOT--
( APPLAUSE )BUT THAT'S NOT-- THAT'S NOT
EXCULPATORY THAT IT CAPTUREDDEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.
>> NO, BUT THE INTELLIGENCE WASWHAT IT WAS.
WE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLELIKE ME COULDN'T MAKE IT UP.
>> Jon:  THE INTELLIGENCEWASN'T WHAT IT WAS AND NOT
EVERYBODY GOT IT WRONG.
>> ALMOST EVERYBODY DID, EXCEPTFOR KNIGHT RIDDER.
ALMOST EVERYBODY DID. I WENTBACK AND LOOKED --
>> Jon: "USA TODAY" HAD ANARTICLE WHERE -- BUT LET'S,
LET'S GO BACK TO  -- >> WE ALL HAD ARTICLES.
I HAD AN ARTICLE -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AN INTERVIEW WITH HANS BLIX,IN WHICH HE SAID I KNOW THEY
ARE STILL NOT, THE IRAQIS ARESTILL NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH
THE 17 RESOLUTIONS THAT WE'VE--THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAS PASSED,
BUT I DON'T WANT THEM-- I DON'TTHINK THIS IS GROUNDS TO GO TO
WAR.
AND I PUBLISHED THAT ARTICLE.
>> Jon: BUT SOMEBODY, SOMEBODYPOINTED THE LIGHT AT IRAQ, AND
THAT SOMEBODY IS THE WHITE HOUSEAND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND
RUMSFELD.
>> ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: HE SAID RIGHTAFTER 9/11 FIND ME A PRETEXT TO
GO TO WAR WITH IRAQ.
THAT'S FROM CAMBONE, THAT'S FROMTHE 9/11 PAPERS AND THE STUDY.
>> I THINK THE REPORTERS WHOWERE COVERING W.M.D., DID NOT
KNOW THAT-- AT LEASTI DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
BUT SECONDLY -->> YEAH.
>> SECONDLY, IT WAS BILLCLINTON WHO WAS WORRIED ABOUT
IRAQ, WHO LONG BEFORE GEORGEBUSH BOMBED IRAQ, BILL CLINTON
DID.
>> Jon:  RIGHT.
>> 1998, FOR W.M.D.
>> Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> I THINK THAT WHAT CHANGED WASTHAT AFTER 9/11, WHAT THE RISK
THAT AMERICA WAS WILLING TOTOLERATE JUST PLUMMETED, AND AS
CHENEY FAMOUSLY SAID,IF THERE'S A 1% CHANCE
OF THIS BEING USED --
>> Jon: I THINK THAT'S,BUT THAT'S AN ABSOLUTELY MYOPIC
ARGUMENT BECAUSE THE ONLY PLACEWE FOCUSED ON WAS IRAQ.
>>  I HAD BEEN COVERINGSADDAM SINCE 1978.
I HAD WATCHED HIM USE CHEMICALWEAPONS AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> I HAD COVERED THE MASSGRAVES OF HALABJA.
>> Jon: SURE.
>> I KNEW HE WOULDN'T HESITATEA MINUTE TO DO IT AGAIN IF HE
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY.
BUT I STILL THINK IF I GOTINFORMATION THAT HAD LED ME TO
BELIEVE -->> YOU DON'T-- YOU DON'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU WERE MANIPULATED?
OR THAT YOU-->> ALL JOURNALISTS ARE
MANIPULATED.
AND ALL POLITICIANS LIE.
THEY ALL TRY AND SPIN.
>> Jon:  WELL, THEN LET'SGO-- LET'S TAKE SPECIFICS OF ONE
SPECIFIC CASE BECAUSE I THINK ITGOES TO THE EFFORTS THAT WE TOOK
TO NOT BE LESSENING THE THREATOF IRAQ, AND THE EFFORTS WE
TOOK TO HEIGHTEN THE THREAT OFIRAQ.
SO THIS IS JUST ONE-- WE'LL GOONE SPECIFIC, AND IT'S THE BIG
NUCLEAR TUBES FIASCO.
AND THAT'S SHOULD WE DO THATNOW?
OR DO WE HAVE TO, OKAY,APPARENTLY BUDWEISER HAS --
WHAT DO THEY HAVE BEER AND THEYWANT PEOPLE TO SELL IT?
ALL RIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WE'RE GOING TO TALK WITH JUDITHMILLER RIGHT AFTER THIS.
