>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW, MY NAME IS JON STEWART,
MAN!
DO WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW FOR
YOU TONIGHT.
TONIGHT'S GUEST PETER TOMSEN,
AUTHOR OF A NEW BOOK "THE
WARS OF AFGHANISTAN" THAT'S
RIGHT, PLURAL, WARS.
AS YOU KNOW, DEBT CEILING
DISCUSSIONS, COMING DOWN TO
THE WIRE.
POLITICAL LEADERS ON BOTH
SIDES PULLING OUT ALL THE
STOPS.
ALL THE STOPS.
LIKE THE KIND OF STOPS THAT
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACHES
USE BEFORE HOMECOMING GAMES
IN PARTICULAR AT THISCIOUS
SMALL TOWNS.
>> KEVIN McCARTHY A THIRD
RANKING REPUBLICAN IN THE
HOUSE URGED REPUBLICANS TO
UNITE BEHIND BOEHNER'S PLAN
BY SHOWING THIS CLIP FROM
THE MOVIE "THE TOWN"
>> THE TOWN?
(LAUGHTER)
"THE TOWN", NO RUDY-- "RUDY"
"BRIAN SONG" OR "300" OR
"ROCKY" OR "ROCKY 2" OR
"ROCKY 3" OR REALLY ANY OF
THE "ROCKIES" YOU WENT WITH
THE BOSTON BANK RUBBERS IN
NUN COSTUMES CLIP.
>> WELL, THERE IS GOING TO
BE GOOD.
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S SEE THE CLIP--
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> THAT THE REPUBLICANS USED,
LET'S SEE THE CLIP THAT THE
REPUBLICANS USED TO URGE
THEIR HARD LINE TEA PARTY
FRESHMAN COALITION TO DROP
THEIR OBJECTIONS TO JOHN
BOEHNER'S DEBT CEILING PLAN
AND VOTE WITH THEIR MORE
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN
BRETHREN.
>> I NEED YOUR HELP.
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT IT IS.
YOU CAN NEVER ASK ME ABOUT
IT LATER.
AND WE'RE GOING TO HURT SOME
PEOPLE.
>> WHICH CAR ARE WE GOING TO
TAKE?
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: LET ME SEE IF I
UNDERSTAND THIS METAPHOR.
THE ESTABLISHMENT
REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING TO
THE TEA PARTY UPSTARTS HEY,
YOU KNOW THE VIOLENT,
UNSTABLE BORDERLINE SOCIO
PATH FROM "THE TOWN"
WHO'S USEFUL IN A PINCH BUT
WHOSE SUICIDAL SINGLE MINDED
MANIA WILL ULTIMATELY BE HIS
DOWNFALL?
THAT'S YOU GUYS.
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE GUY WHO IS STUCK IN
AN UNEASY ALLIANCE WITH YOU
BUT DOESN'T REALLY LIKE YOU
AND ULTIMATELY SAVES HIMSELF
BY WALKING AWAY FROM YOU AS
YOU ARE DYING, THAT'S US.
(LAUGHTER)
SO DO WE HAVE YOUR VOTE?
(LAUGHTER)
I'M GOING TO ASSUME MOST OF
THE TEA PARTY COALITION HAS
NOT SEEN THE WHOLE MOVIE.
>> ALLEN WEST LIKED WHAT HE
HEARD.
>> SO I GOT UP AND TOLD THE
SPEAKER I WILL DRIVE THE
CAR.
(LAUGHTER)
QUICK, ROBIN, TO THE BAT
[BLEEP] MOBILE.
STILL, IF NOTHING ELSE, THE
DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE TO THE
REPUBLICAN'S USE OF THAT
CLIP FROM THE MOVIE "THE
TOWN" DID LEAD TO ONE OF MY
FAVORITE RECENT MOMENTS IN
CABLE NEWS.
I GIVE YOU CHUCK SCHUMER
MASCHUGANA MOVIE BREAKDOWN.
>> IN THE SCENE THEY INSPIRE
THEIR HOUSE FRESHMAN, ONE OF
THE CROOKS GIVES A PEP TALK
TO THE OTHER, RIGHT BEFORE
THEY BOTH PUT ON HOCKEY
MASKS, BLUDGEON TWO MEN WITH
STICKS, AND SHOOT A MAN IN
THE LEG.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: ALL TALKING IN A
RIDICULOUS BOSTON ACCENT.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
JOIN US NEXT WEEK WHEN I,
CHUCK SCHUMER, REVIEW THE
SCI-FI CLASSIC "THE STAR
WARS"
>> AN ASTHMATIC MAN DRESSED
IN BLACK PLASTIC CUTS THE
ARM OFF OF THE BOY WEARING
PAJAMAS WITH SOME TYPE OF A
GLOW STICK.
(LAUGHTER)
AND HERE'S THE PART YOU
WON'T BELIEVE.
THE MAN IN THE SUIT IS THE
BOY'S FATHER.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
THAT MUST BE THE WORST DVD
