[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOME STEVE
COOGAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
>> NICE TO BE HERE.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, FOREVERYBODY THAT KNOWS YOU AND
YOUR GREAT COMEDY, THIS IS ASURPRISING PROJECT FOR YOU TO
TAKE ON.
BRIEFLY WHAT IS THE STORY OFTHIS AND HOW DID YOU GET
INVOLVED IN IT?
>> I READ AN ARTICLE IN THEGUARDIAN NEWSPAPER HERE IN NEW
YORK DOING THE MOVIE CALLED THEOTHER GUYS WITH WILL FERRELL.
>> Jon: YES, VERY FUNNY.
>> THE DOWNTIME IN THE SCENESPLAYING A BRITISH (bleep)
WHICH I'M QUITE GOOD AT, I SAWTHIS ARTICLE IN
THE NEWSPAPER ABOUTTHIS OLD LADY WITH THE TITLE
"THE CATHOLIC CHURCH STOLE MYCHILD."
IT WAS ABOUT HIM BEING ADOPTEDFALSELY AND TAKEN TO AMERICA AND
HER STORY OF HER SEARCH FOR HERSON.
IT SOUNDED FULL OF LAUGHS TOME.
>> Jon: A GOOD SEQUEL TO THEOTHER GUYS.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> THERE WAS A PHOTOGRAPH OF
PHILOMENA AND THEY WERELAUGHING.
I THOUGHT IF I COULD GET A LAUGHIN THE TRAGIC STORY MAYBE I
COULD GET SOMETHING WORTHWATCHING.
>> Jon: THAT IS THEINCREDIBLE -- IT'S, MAN, IT'S A
MOVING STORY.
IT'S A DARK STORY AT TIMES.
IT'S POWERFUL.
THERE ARE A TON OF LAUGHS IN IT.
YOU KNOW THIS, IF YOU WANT TOTALK ABOUT SERIOUS TOPICS AND
YOU WANT TO WIN OVER AN ARGUMENTOR MAKE YOUR POINT, IF YOU
GET PEOPLE LAUGHING THEY LETTHEIR GUARD DOWN AND THEY ARE
MORE OPEN TO THE ARGUMENT YOUARE PUTTING.
SO PUTTING LAUGHS INTO SERIOUSSTUFF A GOOD THING.
>> Jon: HOW HARD WAS IT FORYOU.
THERE'S MOMENTS IN THE FILMWHERE I'M WATCHING YOU BE
SERIOUS AND EARNEST, THECOMEDIAN IN ME, MY HEART WANTS
TO REACH OUT AND GO, "DO A DICKJOKE."
[LAUGHTER]WHY DON'T
YOU FART?
>> I WAS TEMPTED.
[LAUGHTER]THERE ARE PLENTY OF JOKES IN
THERE.
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO HAVETHE BALLS TO SAY NO JOKES NOW.
YOU SHOULD PRACTICE THATSOMETIME.
>> Jon: I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO.
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE.
I'M A TYPICAL REPRESSED BRIT.
IT'S HOW I AM.
[LAUGHTER]YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS --
IT'S THIS WOMAN'S STORY.
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
THERE'S CONTROVERSY NOW ABOUTTHIS WHOLE THING THAT IT'S
ANTI-CATHOLIC.
YOU HAD SAID THAT YOU FELT LIKETHE POPE WOULD LIKE IT.
>> I THINK AS POPES GO, YOUKNOW --
[LAUGHTER]-- HE SEEMS PRETTY GOOD.
>> Jon: SEEMS REALLY GOOD.
>> AS POPES GO.
>> Jon: HE DOES.
HE'S AT THE TOP OF THE POPELIST.
>> WE HOPE HE WILL TAKE A LOOKAT IT.
IT'S NOT ANTI-RELIGIOUS.
IT'S ALSO ABOUT FORGIVENESS.
I PLAY THE SMUG CONCEITEDLIBERAL.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW ANY OFTHEM.
>> Jon: NOT HERE IN NEW YORK.
MAYBE OUT IN THE MIDWEST.
>> HE GETS HIS IN THE END OFMOVIE.
THERE'S BALANCE THERE.
>> Jon: SHE RETAINS FAITH.
IT'S NOT A STORY NECESSARILY OFCHURCH BUT OF THE TIME.
OF AN ERA WHEN THIS WAS VIEWEDDIFFERENTLY THAN IT IS NOW.
>> IT IS ABOUT THAT.
>> IT'S ABOUT HOW THINGS HAVECHANGED,
BUT ALSO THE NATURE OF FAITH.
IT WAS ONCE SAID NO ONE HAS AMONOPOLY ON WISDOM.
MARTIN IS SECULAR IN THE MOVIE.
HE IS NONRELIGIOUS AND PHILOMENAIS RELIGIOUS TO THE END.
HE DOESN'T FIND GOD AND SHECONTINUES TO BELIEVE IN GOD BUT
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER ANDRESPECT EACH OTHER.
>> Jon: HAS SHE SEEN IT?
WAS SHE ABLE TO SEE IT?
>> YEAH, SHE'S BEEN ON THEPUBLICITY TRAIL WITH US.
SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T SHUT HER UP.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: HAVE YOU TRIED LEANING
IN AND GOING SHUT THE (bleep).
>> I HAVE BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.
>> Jon: WHAT?
>> YEAH, I KNOW.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: YOU MUST FEEL
INCREDIBLE BURDEN WHEN YOU ARETELLING SOMEONE'S STORY LIKE
THAT TO BE THE CARETAKER OF THATSTORY.
DID YOU WATCH IT WITH HER.
WERE YOU IN THE ROOM?
>> NO, NO I WOULDN'T DO THAT.
NO, NO.
SHE WAS -- AT FIRST SHE WASNERVOUS ABOUT IT.
WE POKE FUN AT HER, HER LITTLEOLD CONSERVATIVE BLUE COLLAR
WAYS.
BUT IN THE END SHE EMERGESHEROICALLY.
SHE GETS A FREE PASS.
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE CRITICISM,SOME OF IT CAME FROM THE NEW
YORK POST.
>> Jon: NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT.
>> IT'S A HIGHLY INTELLIGENTNEWSPAPER.
>> Jon: OWNED BY A BRILLIANTMEDIA MAGNATE.
>> A LOVELY GUY NAMED RUPERTMURDOCH.
HE'S SO KIND ABOUT PEOPLE ANDGOOD VALUES.
>> Jon: SOUNDS LIKE A GOODCHRISTIAN FELLA.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
IF YOU GET CRITICIZED BY "THENEW YORK POST" THEN YOU ARE
DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.
>> Jon: OR YOU ARE IN A HOTTUB SUCKING ON SOMEONE'S TOES.
THAT'S THE MOST RECENT.
>> THAT'S NEXT ON MY LIST.
>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE CITYTHEN.
PHILOMENA IS IN THEATERSNOW.
IT'S DOING GANGBUSTERS AND IT'SGREAT AND YOU ARE GREAT IN IT.
