>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS A GOOD
ONE.
HERE'S WHAT WE'VE GOT GOING.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS KEVIN
CLASH, BETTER KNOWN AS THE
VOICE OF ELMO AND YES I DO
PLAN ON TICKLING HIM.
SO I SPENT THE WEEKEND
WATCHING A LITTLE FOOTBALL,
BASEBALL, HAVING SOME SNACKS.
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS
OCCUPYING THIS WEEKEND?
ME STREET.
I WAS OUT, I'M A LITTLE OVERLY
THEATRICAL AS WELL.
IT'S BEEN A BORING NEWS
WEEKEND.
DID I MISS ANYTHING.
>> RICK PERRY.
>> AFGHANISTAN.
>> HERMAN CAIN'S BIZARRE....
>> McRIBS.
>> Jon: ONE AT A TIME.
ONE AT A TIME.
>> TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY
BROUGHT THE ISSUE OVER THE
PRESIDENT'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE
BACK IN THE HEADLINES IN AN
INTERVIEW WITH PARADE
MAGAZINE.
>> PERRY SUGGESTED HE WENT
QUITE SURE IF THE PRESIDENT'S
BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS LEGIT.
>> Jon: DIDN'T THAT BOAT SAIL
LAST SPRING?
APPARENTLY RICK PERRY, SEEN
HERE ON THE COVER OF PARADE
MAGAZINE, SUGGESTED...
SUGGESTIVELY OFFERING THE
NATION HIS NIPPLE.
"HEY, AMERICA, HEY, AMERICA.
ARE YOU HUNGRY?"
"ARE YOU HUNGRY?
DO YOU WANT TO SUCKAL?"
"THAT'S GOOD TEAT RIGHT THERE.
SUCK ON A GOOD BARBECUE
SAUCE."
PERRY HAS PICKED UP THE TORCH
EVEN DONALD TRUMP DROPPED SIX
MONTHS AGO THAT SUGGESTS
PERHAPS NONE OF US HAVE SEEN
THE PRESIDENT'S REAL BIRTH
CERTIFICATE.
THIS REPRESENTS PROGRESS.
RIGHT NOW HE'S ONLY SIX MONTHS
BEHIND THE NATIONAL
CONVERSATION.
BUT HIS N-WORD FAMILY HUNTING
GROUND WAS LIKE 150 YEARS
BEHIND.
SO IN MANY WAYS PERRY IS
ACTUALLY GAINING TIME.
NORMALLY PERRY GOES BIRTHER,
NO TIME.
>> HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER ERIC
CANTOR WAS SUPPOSED TO PEEK AT
PEN WHARTON SCHOOL OF
BUSINESS.
>> BUT HIS OFFICE CANCELED THE
APPEARANCE AFTER LEARNING 300
SEATS WOULD BE OPEN TO THE
PUBLIC.
>> Jon: OH, THE PUBLIC.
HEAVENS TO BETSY, WELL, I
NEVER.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
HOLD ON.
I'M SORRY.
SORRY.
I MEANT TO SAY YOU SOUND LIKE
A... SERIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING TO
GIVE A SPEECH ABOUT INCOME
INEQUALITY BUT YOU CANCEL IT?
I GUESS TO ERIC CANTOR 300
EMPTY SEATS FEELS LIKE THIS.
