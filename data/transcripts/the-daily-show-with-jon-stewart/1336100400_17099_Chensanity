THE KILLING.
HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO IT HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO IT.
BUT OF COURSE CHALLENGING STILL AWAIT.
WE TURN OUR ATTENTION TO OUR CURRENT DEBT HOLDERS AND FUTURE OVERLORDS, CHINA.
>> HILLARY CLINTON IS IN CHINA NEGOTIATING SENSITIVE ISSUES FROM IRAN TO NORTH
KOREA, ALL GOING PRETTY WELL UNTIL.
>> CHINA'S BEST KNOWN DISDIDN'TS HAS MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM HOUSE ARREST.
SAID HE IS BEING HID INSIDE THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BEIJING.
>> CHEN'S DASH FOR FREEDOM COULDN'T COME AT A MORE AGO WAURD TIME FOR THE U.S..
>> Jon: WAY TO GO, CHEN!
I MEAN HOW INCONSIDERATE CAN YOU GET!
BLIND HUMAN ACTIVIST CHEN GUANGCHENG.
COULDN'T WAIT JUST TWO MORE WEEKS TO ESCAPE OPPRESSION.
TRY THINKING ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE FOR A CHANGE.
JAILED WORKING TO END CHINA'S FORCED ABORTION AND STERILIZATION POLICIES GUY.
SO WHAT.
HE HAS-- YEAH, I KNEW YOU WOULD LIKE THAT.
CHEN, HE HAS ESCAPED HIS STATE OPPRESSERS DURING A HIGH PROFILE U.S. DIPLOMATIC TRIP.
TO BIGGIE.
>> THERE IS A VERY PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENT FOR THE CHINESE REGIME.
THIS IS AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE.
THEY DON'T LIKE HAVING THEIR DIRTY LAUNDRY, AS THEY SEE T HUNG OUT FOR THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO SEE.
>> Jon: MUST AVOID CHINESE LAUNDRY JOKE.
(LAUGHTER) FIND STRENGTH IN INSPIRATIONAL BRACELET.
(LAUGHTER) WWDRD WHAT WOULD DON RICKLES DO.
(LAUGHTER) SO WHAT DOES CHEN WANT?
>> ACCORDING TO ONE REPORT CHEN HAS ASKED TO LEAVE ON THE SAME PLANE AS HILLARY CLINTON.
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S A LITTLE BIT FORWARD THERE FELLOW.
>> WE UNDERSTAND THAT HE ALSO TOLL HER IN BROKEN ENGLISH, I WOULD LIKE TO KISS YOU.
(LAUGHTER) RZ I LOVE THIS GUY.
MOM, REQUEST WE KEEP HIM?
ALL THINGS LOOK PRETTY GOOD.
THE U.S. LOOKS LIKE A BEACON OF FREEDOM.
CHINA LOOKS SLICELY MORE PROGRESSIVE FOR LETTING CHEN GO AND WE ALL GET TO PRETEND
OUR I PHONES AREN'T MADE BY SLAVE LABOR.
SO IT'S A WIN-WIN.
JUST HOURS AFTER CHEN GUANGCHENG LEFT THE U.S.
EMBASSY HE SAID THE U.S.
BROKERED DEAL WAS NOT THE HUMANITARIAN VICTORY OT BAMA ADMINISTRATION PORTRAYED.
IN FACT, TO NOW SUGGEST THE U.S. FAILED IT TO EFFECTIVELY PROTECT HIM AND HIS FAMILY.
>> DE FEAR FOR HIS LIFE THAT HE WAS ALSO SAYING HE FELT THE EMBASSY LET HIM DOWN.
THAT THEY ALMOST FORCED HIM TO LEAVE [BLEEP].
