[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]NOW -- WE ALL KNOW THAT TWO GAY
MEN IN A LOVING COMMITTEDRELATIONSHIP POSES A THREAT TO
OUR AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE.
WE ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT TWO GAYLADIES WERE OKAY WITH US.
BUT WE FIND OUT OTHERWISE INTONIGHT'S SPECIAL EDITION OF GAY
WATCH, LESBIAN LIFECYCLE.
â™ª FIRST --
[LAUGHTER]-- WE BEGIN --
[LAUGHTER]I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A STOCK
PHOTO OR NOT BUT --[LAUGHTER]
FIRST, WE BEGIN WITH ONE OF MOSTIMPORTANT MILESTONES IN A
WOMAN'S LIFE.
YOU MEET SOMEONE, IN THIS CASEANOTHER WOMAN, YOU FALL IN LOVE
AND YOU GET MARRIED AND THEN ANDONLY THEN IF YOU ARE BOTH READY?
>> THE JUDGE RULED THAT TWO SANANTONIO WOMEN MARRIED IN ANOTHER
STATE CAN LEGALLYGET A DIVORCE HERE IN TEXAS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: THEY DID IT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]TRUE DISDAIN REALLY DOES CONQUER
ALL.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THE CASE COULD HAVE RIPPLEEFFECTS BECAUSE THE STATE OF
TEXAS DOES NOT RECOGNIZESAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND IN THIS
CASE IS RECOGNIZING SAME-SEXDIVORCE.
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT. THERECOULD BE A SLIPPERY SLOPE THAT
WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO SAMESEX TRIAL SEPARATIONS, SAME SEX
LABOR DAY BARBEQUES, SAME SEXQUINCEANERAS. SAME SEX
BAR MITZVAHS. IT'SA SLOPERY SLOPE.
I'M JUST WONDERING THOUGH, WHYDO THEY NEED A DIVORCE IF
THE STATE DOESN'T CONSIDERTHEM MARRIED?
>> ALLISON FLOOD LESH HASN'TSEEN 14 MONTH OLD KATELYN
SINCE NOVEMBER SHORTLY AFTER SHEAND
HER WIFE OF THREE YEARS DECIDEDTO SEPARATE.
>> Jon: OH RIGHT, LEGALPROTECTION. SHE NEEDS TO GET
A DIVORCE IN ORDER TO GET THELEGAL RIGHT TO SEE HER KID.
RIGHT, WELL THAT SOUNDSREASONABLE.
>> LESH'S WIFE ASKED THE JUDGETO TOSS THE CASE SINCE GAY
MARRIAGE ISN'T LEGAL INTEXAS BUT LATE TUESDAY
THE JUDGE DENIED THAT REQUEST.
>> Jon: WOW, TAKING ADVANTAGEOF THE STATE'S HOMOPHOBIC
MARRIAGE LAWS JUST TO GET BACKAT YOUR EX.
THAT IS IMPRESSIVE TO SEE ALESBIAN PULLING SUCH A DICK
MOVE. THAT IS --[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
NICE.
NICE.
ON TO THE NEXT STAGE IN THECYCLE OF A LESBIANS LIFE.
RETIREMENT, A JOYFULREFLECTIVE TIME THOUGH LESS SO
WHEN SAID RETIREMENTWAS NOT VOLUNTARY.
SUCH WAS THE CASE FOR LATTASOUTH CAROLINA POLICE CHIEF
CRYSTAL MOORE WHO CLAIMS SHE WASFIRED AFTER 23
YEARS ON THE FORCE BECAUSE OFHER SEXUAL ORIENTATION.
BUT WAS SHE? WAS SHE?
>> SOME RESIDENTS BELIEVETHE MAYOR FIRING CRYSTAL WAS
PAYBACK. CHIEF MOOREINVESTIGATED MAYOR BULLARD'S
MOST RECENT HIRE. CHIEF MOOREFOUND THE MAYOR
NEGLECTED TO CONDUCT ABACKGROUND CHECK ON SELLERS.
>> Jon: AND, IF HE HAD RUN ABECOMEGROUND CHECK THE MAYOR
WOULD HAVE FUND OUT THAT VONTRAYSELLERS HAD CRASHED HIS CAR IN
A DITCH WHILE DRUNK DRIVING.
SO, IT IS POSSIBLE THIS ISN'T ACASE OF HOMOPHOBIA AND JUST SOME
GOOD OLD FASHIONED SMALLTOWN CRONYISM.
>> THE CITY'S NEW MAYOR EARLBULLARD WHO WAS SECRETLY
RECORDED BY A COUNCIL MEMBER.
>> I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVESOMEBODY WHO DRANK AND DRANK TOO
MUCH TAKING CARE OF MY CHILDTHAN I HAVE SOMEBODY WHOSE
LIFESTYLE IS QUESTION ABLEAROUND CHILDREN.
>> Jon: OKAY HOMOPHOBIA ITWAS. ALRIGHT, I'M SORRY. NO,
HE'S JUST SAYING HIS CHILDCARE HIERARCHY IS THIS.
HIS FIRST CHOICE, HIS EXWIFE,SECOND CHOICE 15-YEAR-OLD DOWN
THE STREET WITH ADD.THEN DRUNK GUY, THEN
ESCAPED MENTAL PATIENT, THENTORONTO CRACK
SMOKING MAYOR ROB FORD AND THENFIGMENT OF HIS IMAGINATION AND
THEN AND ONLY THEN A RESPONSIBLELESBIAN WHO RUNS AN ACCREDITED
AND LICENSED CHILD CAREFACILITY. SIR, JUST OUT OF
CURIOSITY, WHY CAN'T A LESBIANTAKE CARE OF YOUR CHILD?
>> BECAUSE THAT AIN'T THE DAMNWAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.
>> Jon: SAYS IT RIGHT THERE INTHE BIBLE.
GOD SAYth UNTO MOSES, THOUSHALT LEAVE THY SON TO BE
WATCHED BY YE WHO DRUNKENLYABANDONED HIS CAR IN A DITCH.
SO SAYETH THE LORD.
SO, LESBIANS DON'T GET TO TAKEPART IN EVERY DAY LIFE EVEN THE
BAD PARTS LIKE DIVORCE AND WORK.AT LEAST TELL ME THEY
ARE TREATED EQUALLY AT THE ENDOF THE LIFE CYCLE.
>> IN IDAHO, A NAVY VET ISMOURNING THE DEATH OF HER LATE
WIFE BUT MADELEINE TAYLOR ISALSO MOURNING SOMETHING ELSE.
THE STATE RUN VETERANS CEMETERYWHERE TAYLOR HOPES TO BE BURIED
ONE DAY IS REFUSING TO BURY HERWITH HER WIFE'S REMAINS.
>> Jon: YE YOU (bleep).
CONGRATULATIONS IDAHO YOUFIGURED OUT HOW TO SCREW GAY
PEOPLE FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE.
AND A VETERAN NO LESS. LET METELL YOU SOMETHING,
THIS WOMAN BETTER NOT BEADORABLE OR YOU ARE IN TROUBLE.
>> TAYLOR  WAS HOPING THEY WOULDAPPROVE IT SINCE THEIR ASHES
WOULD FIT IN ONE SPOT ON THEWALL.
>> IT'S NOT TAKING UP ANY MORESPACE TO HAVE BOTH OF US IN
THERE. I DON'T SEE WHERETHE ASHES OF OF A COUPLE
OF OLD LESBIANS IS GOINGTO HURT ANYBODY.
>> Jon: IDAHO. YOU ARETELLING ME YOU DON'T
WANT TO SEE THAT SWEET OLDLADY, BURNED TO
ASHES AND PLACED IN -- [LAUGHTER]
