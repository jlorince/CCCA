>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW! MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A PROGRAM FOR YOUTONIGHT.
MY GUEST JENNIFER LOPEZ WILLJOIN US TO DISCUSS A VARIETY OF
TOPICS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]BUT FIRST, OBVIOUSLY
TONIGHT WAS THE STATE OF THEUNION ADDRESS.
I NOT GOING TO GO OVER INALL IN DETAIL RIGHT NOW.
IT WAS ALL VERY PREDICTABLE.
OBAMA TOOK THE STAGE.
AND DID HIS USUAL, AMERICA BAD.
AMERICA'S ENEMY'S RIGHT.
HE BURNED A FLAG, BIDEN MOONED,HE DROPPED THE MIC THAT WAS IT.
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHO'S GOTNEXT.
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'SDEMOCALYPSE 2016:
PREMATURE ELECTULATION.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE.
VERY EXCITING.
WHAT FRESH NEW FACES 2016 HAS INSTORE FOR US.
>> MITT ROMNEY APPARENTLY BACKONBOARD AFTER TWO LOSING
CAMPAIGNS.
>> IS MITT ROMNEY REALLY GOINGTO RUN AGAIN IN 2016?
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: HA HA! WOO, THAT IS THE
STUPIDEST [BEEP] QUESTION I HAVEEVER -- YES HE'S RUNNING.
HE IS DOING IT AGAIN.
THE ONCE AND FUTURE NOTPRESIDENT REVEALED HIS POSSIBLE
PLANS TO RUN-ISH LAST WEEK ATTHE WINTER MEETING OF REPUBLICAN
PARTY LEADERS.
>> NOW THERE'S SOME SPECULATIONABOUT WHETHER I'M ABOUT TO
EMBARK ON A POLITICAL ENDEAVORIN WHICH I HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY
UNSUCCESSFUL. LET ME STATEUNEQUIVOCALLY THAT I HAVE NO
INTENTION OF RUNNING FOR U.S.SENATOR OF MASSACHUSETS.
>> Jon: BOOM!
YOU THOUGHT -- YOU THOUGHT HEWAS TALKING ABOUT THE
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONTHAT HE LOST.
HE WAS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT AMUCH SMALLER SENATE RACE THAT HE
ALSO LOST.
SEE IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE HE ALWAYSLOSES.
[LAUGHING]YOU KNOW WHAT I KID.
I KID.
HE'S A VERY ACCOMPLISHEDSUCCESSFUL MAN.
WHOSE SUPPORTERS WILL STANDBEHIND HIM NO MATTER HOW MANY
TIMES HE LOSES OR HOW MUCH OFTHEIR MONEY HE WASTES.
>> THE ROMNEY FACE TATTOO GUYSAYS HE IS NOT SUPPORTING MITT
ROMNEY IN 2016.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: I'M GOING TO SAY
SOMETHING.
THAT'S GOT TO STING.
I THINK A SIGN THAT YOURCAMPAIGN IS IN TROUBLE IS WHEN
IT CAN NO LONGER ASSUME THESUPPORT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE
ENGRAVED YOUR INITIALS ON THEIRFACE.
MEANWHILE, I CAN ONLY ASSUMEFACE TATTOO GUY IS ACTIVELY
SEARCHING OUT CANDIDATES TOSUPPORT WHO HAVE THE LETTER "R"
SOMEWHERE IN THEIR NAME.
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING WITHJEB BUSH.
I REALLY LIKE THIS TED C-RUZ.
QUIT BEING A NOMINATION HOG,MITT!
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHODESERVE A CHANCE TO LOSE A
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
LIKE NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRISCHRISTIE.
>> NEW JERSEY IS STRUGGLING.THEIR ECONOMY IS STILL SLUGGISH.
>> JERSEY RANKS 49TH IN JOBCREATION.
>> THEY HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM INTERMS OF THEIR PENSIONS.
>> NEW JERSEY DOWNGRADED EIGHTTIMES BY S&P.
>> Jon: EIGHT?
THEY'VE BEEN DOWNGRADED EIGHTTIMES.
HOW MANY TIMES CAN S&P DOWNGRADEYOU BEFORE YOU BOTTOM OUT
OF THEIR SCALE.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, NEW JERSEY, I'MGOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
FIVE DOWNGRADES IS THE MOSTWE'VE EVER GIVEN SOMEONE BEFORE.
WE'VE ALREADY BLOWN THROUGH THELETTER GRADES SO NOW WE'RE JUST
GOING TO GIVE YOU A POOPEMOJI SIGN.
WE DON'T KNOW, WE DON'T KNOWWHAT ELSE TO DO.
TECHNICALLY WHAT THIS MEANS NOWIS THAT YOU'RE JUST A LOOSE
CONGLOMERATION OF TRIBES.
SO, CHRISTIE'S STATE HAS SOMEPROBLEMS, WHICH IS WHY
I ASSUME HE USED LAST WEEK'SSTATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS TO
PROVE HE ISN'T SO FOCUSED ON THENATIONAL OFFICE THAT HE HAS LOST
SIGHT OF PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY.
>> STATES ACROSS THECOUNTRY ARE STRUGGLING.
I SAW IT ON THE STREETS OFCHICAGO
AND FELT IT IN THE SUBURBS OFMARYLAND.
I HEARD FROM FARMERS IN KANSASAND FROM TEACHERS IN COLORADO.
I FELT IT FROM VETERANS IN MAINEAND FROM WORKERS IN ARKANSAS.
AN 82-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IN VEROBEACH, FLORIDA.
>> Jon: DID YOU MEET ANYONE FROMNEW JERSEY?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]NEW JERSEY.
I'M SORRY I INTERRUPTED YOURTRAVEL LOG.
>> AN 82-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IN VEROBEACH, FLORIDA.
SHE HELD ONTO MY HAND TIGHT,AND SHE SAID WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO OUR COUNTRY?
WE USE TO CONTROL EVENTS. NOWEVENTS CONTROL US.
>> Jon: I MEAN I USED TO BEYOUNG, BUT NOW I'M OLD.
I HAD A GRANDMOTHER.
NOW I AM A GRANDMOTHER.
GOVERNOR CHRISTIE HOW COME YOUPARK ON A DRIVEWAY AND DRIVE ON
A PARKWAY. OBAMA.
THIS ELECTION IS GOING TO BESUCH A DRAG.
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOMEONESPECIAL OUT THERE.
A CANDIDATE WHOSE MERECONSIDERATION OF RUNNING WOULD
FILL ME WITH THE JOY BORDERINGGIDDINESS.
>> WE SET UP A TESTINGTHE WATERS COMMITTEE UNDER THE
IRS CODE THAT WOULD ALLOW METO LOOK BEYOND SOUTH CAROLINA
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A GUYLIKE LINDSEY GRAHAM
HAS A VIABLE PATH.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: THANK YOU, JESUS.
BOYS --♪
♪LINDSEY GRAHAM, I GOT -- WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
LINDSEY GRAHAM, WHY WOULD YOUTHINK IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO RUN
FOR PRESIDENT?
>> I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO LOOKAT IT.
I THINK THE WORLD IS FALLINGAPART, AND I'VE BEEN MORE
IN THE RIGHT THAN WRONG WHEN ITCOMES TO FOREIGN POLICY.
>> Jon: OH, RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'REDELUSIONAL.
HIT IT BOYS. WE'LL BE RIGHTBACK!
