WITH MORE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW IN EUROPE, WE'RE
JOINED BY SENIOR EUROPEAN
CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER.
JOHN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
EVER SINCE THE CREATION OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION THERE HAVE BEEN
NEARLY TWO DECADES OF
UNPRECEDENTED PEACE, PROSPERITY
AND COOPERATION.
SUDDENLY CHAOS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
>> WELL, JUST THAT, JON, WE'VE
BEEN PEACEFULLY CORPORATING.
EUROPE AT ITS BEST IS A
CONTINENT OF ETHNICALLY AND
CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETIES
LIVING IN A STATE OF CONSTANT
WAR WITH EACH OTHER.
>> Jon: WAIT, AT ITS BEST?
>> ABSOLUTELY, JON.
VIOLENT HATRED OF YOUR
NEIGHBORHOODS GIVES YOU A
PERMANENT SENSE OF PURPOSE.
SOMETHING TO CLING TO IN TIMES
OF TROUBLE.
EUROPE IS NEVER MORE STABLE THAN
WHEN IT'S ATTACKING ITSELF.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: I APPRECIATE THE
HISTORY OF EUROPE, BUT WARS
DON'T PROVIDE STABILITY.
>> WHAT?
OF COURSE THEY DO!
(LAUGHTER)
JON, WE HAD A HUNDRED-YEAR WAR!
YOU DON'T GET MUCH MORE STABLE
THAN THAT.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S EASY.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO, EVERY
MORNING...
>> Jon: I DON'T THINK
THAT'S...
>> EVERY MORNING YOU GET UP AND
THINK "WHAT WILL I DO TODAY?
I KNOW, I'LL FIGHT THE FRENCH
LIKE I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE
PREVIOUS 99 YEARS!"
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: WARS AREN'T... WARS
ARE TERRIBLE.
>> YES.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT EUROPEAN WARS DO SOME GREAT
THINGS.
THEY STIMULATE THE GLOBAL
ECONOMY, FOSTER FEELINGS OF
NATIONAL PRIDE, REALLY HELP
EVERYONE BLOW OFF SOME STEAM AND
THE MOVIES ABOUT THEM ARE
TERRIFIC!
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN."
COME ON, JON, THAT'S A BEST
PICTURE WINNER RIGHT THERE.
>> Jon: ACTUALLY, "SAVING
PRIVATE RYAN" DIDN'T WIN.
IT LOST THE "SHAKESPEARE IN
LOVE."
>> ARE YOU (BLEEP)ING KIDDING
ME?
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: THAT'S TRUE.
>> ARE YOU (BLEEP)ING KIDDING
ME?
>> Jon: NO.
>> THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BEEN
NOMINATED, JON!
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT "SAVING
PRIVATE RYAN!"
WHAT A CAST.
SO MANY FUTURE STARS, THE SCORE
WAS SENSATIONAL AND THE
DIRECTION-- AND I KNOW YOU GET
TIRED OF SAYING THIS ABOUT
SPIELBERG-- WAS IMPECCABLE.
"SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE" WAS A
PIECE OF (BLEEP), JON!
THAT'S ANOTHER WHIFF FROM THE
ACADEMY.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND THAT.
POINT'S WELL TAKEN.
GETTING BACK TO EUROPE.
>> IT'S LIKE WHEN "DANCES WITH
WOLVES BEAT GOODFELLAS" ALL OVER
AGAIN.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).
>> Jon: LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, THAT WAS A (BLEEP)ING
DISGRACE.
(LAUGHTER)
SCORSESE IS AT THE TOP OF HIS
GAME, SO MANY UNBELIEVABLE CATCH
PHRASES THAT COME OUT OF THAT
THING.
"DANCING WITH WOLVES", "TONKA."
A TRAVESTY BEYOND WHAT PEOPLE
CONSIDER...
I'M NOT ARGUING.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> I'M NOT ARGUING WITH YOU,
JON, BUT IF WE CAN GET BACK TO
EUROPE...
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> RIGHT NOW IT IS VITAL THAT
SOMEONE AT THE VERY LEAST SHOOT
AN ARCH DUKE AND LET NATURE TAKE
ITS COURSE.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: TO REALLY GET THE BALL
ROLLING, I THINK, WOULDN'T
EUROPE NEED, THOUGH, A KIND OF
DESPOT TO RISE UP AND, IN YOUR
MIND, ANYONE ON THE HORIZON?
>> NO ONE REALLY WORTH PACKING
UP YOUR FAMILY AND CROSSING INTO
SWITZERLAND TO ESCAPE FROM.
(LAUGHTER).
>> Jon: JOHN, EVERYTHING WE'VE
SEEN SEEMS SO SENSELESS.
LOOK AT THE FOOTAGE, THERE'S NO
HOPE, NO RHYME OR REASON,
THERE'S...
>> Jon:THERE'S.
..
>> WHAT?
REALLY?
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT IT THE
RIGHT WAY, JON.
TURN THE FOOTAGE BLACK AND WHITE
AND GIVE ME SOME JAUNTY MUSIC.
WATCH THIS, JON.
SUMMERTIME IN EUROPE AND
EVERYONE'S FEELING THE HEAT.
THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR RAILS
AGAINST THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF
THE GREEKS.
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL A SOUR
KRAUT.
MEANWHILE, HOLLYWOOD'S BRIGHTEST
STARS COME OUT TO SHINE WITH THE
PREMIER OF "THE CHANGEUP."
IT'S ANOTHER CLASSIC SWITCHEROO.
AND THAT'S TODAY'S WORLD NEWS OF
THE WORLD TODAY.
PIP PIP!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: WOW, I'VE GOT TO
ADMIT, THAT FILLED MY HEART A
LITTLE BIT.
REALLY DOES TAKE ME BACK TO THAT
TIME WHEN AMERICA HAD SUCH
PURPOSE AS WELL.
YOU KNOW, THE GREAT ESTROGEN
NATION MANY WAYS...
>> OH, SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN.
EASY NOW.
>> Jon: JUST SAYING, IF
THERE'S GOING TO BE A WAR, MAYBE
AMERICA COULD...
>> COOL IT, COOL IT.
>> Jon: JUMP IN REALLY GOOD...
>> COOL IT.
>> Jon: I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT WE'RE GOOD AT THESE TYPES
OF WARS.
>> NOT SO FAST, JON.
FIRST LET US DO WHAT WE DO: TEAR
OUR ENTIRE CONTINENT APART.
THEN YOU DO WHAT YOU DO: SIT
BACK AND WATCH US, SELL US
WEAPONS, BUILD UP YOUR
STRUGGLING ECONOMY AND THEN AT
THE LAST MINUTE.
>> Jon: SWOOP IN AND SAVE THE
WORLD FROM EVIL!
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT, CAPTAIN AMERICA!
>> Jon: GOOD
