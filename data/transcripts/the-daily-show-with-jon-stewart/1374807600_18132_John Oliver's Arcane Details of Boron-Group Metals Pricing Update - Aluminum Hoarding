GET A PHONE, BARRY!
NOW, YOU MIGHT BE THINKING
SURELY THERE IS A RULE IN PLACE
TO PREVENT ALUMINUM HORDING.
WELL, RELAX, THERE ACTUALLY IS.
THE RULES STATE 3,000 TONS MUST
LEAVE THE WAREHOUSE EACH DAY.
HOWEVER, THAT LEAVES A LOOPHOLE
BIG ENOUGH TO DRIVE SEVERAL
LIEWM-LADEN TRUCK THROUGHS.
>> ON A DAILY BASIS A FLEET OF
TRUCKS MOVE THE ALUMINUM AROUND
AND AROUND FROM ONE WAREHOUSE TO
ANOTHER.
A FORKLIFT DRIVER CALLS IT "A
MERRY-GO-ROUND OF METAL."
>> "A MERRY-GO-ROUND OF METAL.
COINCIDENTALLY, THE MOST POPULAR
RIDE AT HURTSY PARK AND FAMILY
FUN ZONE.
AND THE TRUCK DRIVERS AT THOSE
WAREHOUSES SEEMS TO REALIZE HOW
RIDICULOUS THIS SCHEME IS WITH
ONE WORKER SAYING HE WOULD JOKE
WITH HIS NEPHEW AT ANOTHER
WAREHOUSE ASKING, "DID YOU GET
ALL THAT METAL WE SENT YOU?"
TO WHICH HIS NEPHEW REPLIED,
"YUP.
DID YOU GET ALL THE STUFF WE
SENT YOU."
IT ALL SOUNDS LIKE FUN AND GAMES
BUT I BET YOU THERE'S A
DISILLUSIONED ALUMINUM
DELIVERYMAN SAYING I GOT INTO
THIS BUSINESS TO BRING ALUMINUM
TO THE PEOPLE, MAN.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE
DOING ANYMORE.
( LAUGHTER )
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THERE
USED TO BE RULES PREVENT, BANKS
FROM CONTROLLING PHYSICAL GOODS
SO THAT THEY COULDN'T MANIPULATE
PRICES FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT.
BUT, LIKE MARILU HENNER, THOSE
RULES PRETTY MUCH DISAPPEARED
SOME TIME IN THE 1990s.
BUT THIS IS STILL ENOUGH OF AN
ISSUE THAT ON TUESDAY, AS MANY
AS FOUR, MAYBE EVEN FIVE MEMBERS
OF THE 50-MEMBER SENATE BANKING
SUBCOMMITTEE GATHERED TO HEAR
TESTIMONY ON THE MATTER.
>> THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
BANKING AND COMMODITIES IS NOT A
NEW DEVELOPMENT.
IT HAS VERY ANCIENT ROOTS.
PHYSICAL COMMODITIES SUCH AS
GRAND AND SALT WERE AMONG THE
FIRST FORMS OF MONEY IN ANCIENT
MESOPOTAMIA, EGYPT, CHINA.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> John: YES, BUT THEN, THEY
INVENTED MONEY.
( LAUGHTER )
BY THE WAY, IF YOUR EXCUSE FOR
SERVING, "WELL, HAMARABI DID
IT," THEN I THINK YOU'RE ON
SHAKY GROUND.
DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
( APPLAUSE )
NOW THE COUNTER-POINT OF THE
ARGUMENT IS THIS--
>> JUST BECAUSE SOME BANKS
SOMEWHERE IN THE PAST DID
SOMETHING AND IT WAS OKAY,
DOESN'T MEAN NECESSARILY THAT
IT'S OKAY TODAY.
FOR EXAMPLE, I AM SURE THAT
SOMESOMETIMES SOME BANK HAS
AMPHIBIOUSED SLAVE TRADE, RIGHT.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN J.P. MORGAN
TODAY SHOULD BE FINANCING HUMAN
TRAFFICKING.
>> John: THAT'S A FAIR POINT.
IT'S A FAIR POINT.
I GET IT.
THE PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW THAT
SOMEONE AT J.P. MORGAN JUST SAW
THAT AND WENT, "WAIT.
WE WERE NOT FINANCING HUMAN
RAFFICKING? ?"T
HAVE YOU SEEN THE PROFIT MARGINS
ON ROMANIAN SEX SLAVES?
THEY'RE RIGHT.
I HAVE TO GET INTO THIS MYSELF.
BARRY, BARRY!
BUY!
HOW IS THIS LINE BUSY, BARRY!
HOLD OI'LL USE MY CELL.
BARRY!
BARRY!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
GOOD LUCK.
GOOD LUCK FINDING A STUPIDER
ALUMINUM CAN-BASED JOKE ANYWHERE
ON TELEVISION THIS EVENING.
( LAUGHTER )
IF THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE,
THIS SEEMS PRETTY OBJECTIVELY
OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR.
OR IF YOU WORK FOR A MAJOR
FINANCIAL NEWS NETWORK--
>> I WANT TO TELL THAT YOU I DID
NOT UNDERSTAND THAT STORY.
OKAY, I READ IT THREE TIMES.
I HAD MY PRODUCER, WHO IS VERY
FINANCIALLY LITERATE, READ IT
THREE TIMES.
I DON'T QUITE GET THE SCAM.
I READ THAT STORY HOW MANY
TIMESES?
I READ IT FIVE TIMES.
SOMEHOW THEY MANIPULATED THE
PRICE OF ALUMINUM.
I DON'T KNOW HOW.
>> John: HOW DO YOU NOT GET
IT!
YOU'RE A FINANCIAL EXPERT
SEEMINGLY FLUMMOXED BY THE
EASIEST FINANCIAL STORY IN A
DECADE.
THIS IS SOMETHING A CHILD COULD
UNDERSTAND.
IN FACT, I'LL SHOW YOU.
ELLIOT, ELLIOT.
COME IN HERE, ELLIOT.
ELLIOT.
>> YES?
( APPLAUSE )
>> John: ELLIOT.
>> YES?
>> John: DID YOU READ THAT
STORY ABOUT GOLDMAN SACHS?
>> YES.
THEY'RE ARTIFICIALLY INFLATING
PRICES THROUGH STORAGE.
>> John: JUST TO BE CLEAR,
ELLIOT, YOU UNDERSTOOD IT.
>> OBVIOUSLY, I'M EIGHT AND A
HALF.
>> John: RIGHT, RIGHT.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
ANYTHING ELSE?
>> WHAT GOLDMAN SACHS IS DOING
IS WORSE THAN COOTIES.
>> John: IT IS WORSE THAN
COOTIES, ELLIOT.
THANK YOU, ELLIOT.
>> BY THE WAY, WHEN IS JOHN
COMING BACK.
>> John: JON STEWART IS COMING
BACK IN A FEW WEEKS.
>> OH, THANK GOD.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> John: I'VE GOT--
( LAUGHTER )
SHE'S JUST SAYING WHAT AMERICA
IS THINKING.
RELAX.
I'VE GOT TO SAY, NOW THAT YOU
THINK ABOUT IT, THE NEW VERSION
OF MONOPOLY IS ACTUALLY PERFECT.
YOU JUST MOVE PIECES OF METAL
AROUND AND AROUND IN A CIRCLE,
COLLECTING MONEY WHENEVER YOU
WANT, AND IT'S GUARANTEED THAT
NOBODY IS GOING TO JAIL.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
