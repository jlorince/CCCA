>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO THEDAILY SHOW.
GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE GOT A GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, AYAANHIRSI ALI AUTHOR OF THE BOOK
"HERETIC."
BUT FIRST THE DEPARTMENT OF THEVETERANS AFFAIRS.
OVER THE YEARS THEY HAVEDEVELOPED SOMETHING OF A
REPUTATION OVER THE BACKLOG, THEOBSCENELY LONG WAIT TIMES
FOR APPOINTMENTS, CONTINUEDUSE OF SOFTWARE THAT IS
ROUGHLY AS OLD AS KEIRAKNIGHTLY,
OR AS THE FOLKS AT THE VACALL HER THAT ACTRESS FROM
"THE IMITATION GAME" MOVIE WITHTHE FUTURISTIC COMPUTERS.
PERHAPS I'M BEING TOO HARD ONTHE VA.
THEY HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLYTO CHANGE THEIR WAYS.
>> THE LOS ANGELES VAOFFICIAL DR. SKYE McDOUGALL
TOLD MEMBERS OF CONGRESSWAIT TIMES FOR NEW PATIENTS
AT THE VA CENTERS IN LOSANGELES WERE ABOUT FOUR
DAYS.
>> ASKED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTHWAIT TIMES, THAT SAME VA
OFFICIAL DR. SKYE McDOUGALLTOLD CONGRESS THE WAIT TIME
IS NO DIFFERENT.
SHE SAID JUST FOUR DAYS.
>> Jon: FOUR DAYS!
FINALLY, AND IF YOU CAN'TTRUST SKYE McDOUGALL--
(LAUGHTER)THE WORLD'S GREATEST DOCTOR
AND AVIATRIX, WHO CAN YOUTRUST?
NOW IF THAT'S ALL, CONGRESSMANEXCUSE ME WHILE A LIGHT UP A
LUCKY STRIKE, HOP INTO MY GLENMARTIN BOMBER AND GIVE THE
KAISER WHAT FOR, ALL WHILEKEEPING WAIT TIMES UNDER
FIVE DAYS.
COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU,SKYE McDOUGALL.
(LAUGHTER)BUT THIS IS REASON FOR
CELEBRATION.
THE FOUR DAY WAIT PERIOD ISAWESOME.
IT ALMOST SOUNDS TOOGOOD TO BE TRUE.
IT'S NOT TRUE, IS IT?
>> THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME ISTEN TIMES GREATER.
IT'S NOT FOUR DAYS, IT'S 44DAYS.
>> Jon: OKAY, OKAY, BUTTHERE IS A FOUR IN IT.
(LAUGHTER)44 DAYS!
YOU [BLEEP] FOR THE LASTTIME, McDOUGALL! I'M TURNING IN
YOUR 1930s PILOT LICENSE ANDYOUR FLYING SCARF FROM
GIMBELS.
McDOUGALL.
WELL, I SUPPOSE 44 DAYS ISBETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS
AVERAGE WAIT TIME OF UNTILTHE FIRST ANGEL SOUNDS HIS
TRUMPET AND THE FOURHORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE
BRING WITH THEM HAIL FIREAND BLOOD.
THESE WAIT TIMES AREUNACCEPTABLE, MAN.
DOES THE VA HAVE ANYSOLUTION FOR THIS?
>> THE VA SCANDAL SPARKED ANATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT
VETERAN'S CARE.
IN A RARE SHOW OFBI-PARTISANSHIP CONGRESS CREATED
THE $10 BILLION CHOICE CARDPROGRAM HOPING TO GIVE
VETERANS MORE ACCESS TOCARE.
>> Jon: THE VETERAN'S CHOICEPROGRAM SOUNDS LIKE A
SPECTACULAR PROGRAM.
IT HAS THE WORD CHOICE IN IT.
LIKE OUR BEST BEEF.
(LAUGHTER)AND MOST PRESTIGIOUS AWARDS.
(LAUGHTER)NOW VETERANS WHO HAVE HAD TO
WAIT LONGER THAN 30 DAYS FORAN APPOINTMENT CAN NOW GO
OUTSIDE THE VA SYSTEM FORHEALTH CARE.
WHAT COULD GO WRONG FOR AN89-YEAR-OLD VETERAN OF A
TRAILBLAZING ALL FEMALEWORLD WAR II NAVAL DIVISION
WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO LIVE ONAN ISLAND WITH NO VA
FACILITY ON IT.
>> HEPNER RECENTLY HAD A HEARTATTACK.
AS SHE WAS DISCHARGED FROMTHE HOSPITAL, THE STAFF SET
UP FOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTSWITH A CARDIOLOGIST ON THE
ISLAND.
BUT WHEN HEPPNER CALLED THECHOICE PROGRAM, SHE WAS TOLD
SHE DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR LOCALCARE EVEN THOUGH IT TAKES
HOURS TO GET TO THE NEARESTVA FACILITY 38 MILES AWAY.
>> Jon: OH, RIGHT, THECHOICE PROGRAM REQUIRES THAT
IF YOU HAVEN'T WAITED 30DAYS, YOU MUST LIVE MORE
THAN 40 MILES AWAY FROM A VAFACILITY AS THE CROW
FLIES BECAUSE THAT ISTHE LEAST MEANINGFUL WAY TO
JUDGE HOW HARD IT IS TO GETSOMEWHERE FOR NON-CROWS.
(LAUGHTER)WHAT THE [BLEEP].
AS THE CROW-- LET'S SEE, I'M89 AND I HAD A HEART ATTACK.
GET ME MY ZIP LINE HELMET.
I GOT A DOCTOR'SAPPOINTMENT.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
BUT ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, I DON'TWANT TO OVERREACT.
ONE PERSON IS HAVING TROUBLEWITH THE CHOICE PROGRAM.
OLD WOMEN, OLD WOMAN LIVINGON AN ISLAND IS A PRETTY
UNIQUE SITUATION.
I DON'T SEE HOW THIS THINGCOULD TRIP UP ANYONE ELSE.
>> IT TAKES A TRIP OF MORETHAN 50 MILES BY CAR TO SEE
AN ONCOLOGIST AT THE VAHOSPITAL IN MINNEAPOLIS.
>> PAUL WALKER THOUGHT HE WAS APERFECT CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW VA
CHOICE PROGRAM.
>> UNLESS THE NEXT PART OFTHAT SENTENCE IS AND IT
TURNED OUT HE WAS ANDEVERYONE LIVED HAPPILY EVER
AFTER, I'M NOT SURE I WANTTO SEE WHAT COMES NEXT.
>> HE WAS DENIED.
THE NORTHWEST METRO VACLINIC IN RAMSY IS ONLY 20
MILES FROM HIS HOME.
BUT GET THIS, PAUL SAYS THEYDON'T OFFER CANCER TREATMENT
AT THE CLINIC.
>> ABOUT ALL THEY DO ISDENTAL WORK THERE AND EYE
WORK AND SOME BASICDIFFERENT, YOU KNOW, KINDS
OF MINOR THINGS.
BUT I HAVE CANCER.
>> Jon: WOULDN'T HAPPEN TOBE TOOTH CANCER, WOULD IT?
COME ON, WHAT'S THE DEAL,VA?
WHY ARE YOU BEING SUCH HARDASS WITH THIS 40 MILE RULE?
WHY NOT JUST OPEN THE CHOICEPROGRAM UP A BIT?
>> THE CBO SCORING FOR THEPROGRAM, IF IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN OPEN TO ALL VETERANSWOULD HAVE BEEN $50 BILLION.
THE WAY THEY SET UP THECRITERIA, THAT IS THE 40
MILES AND THE 30 DAY WAITTIME IT WAS ONLY $10 BILLION
SO IT WAS A MONETARYCONSIDERATION BY CONGRESS.
>> OH, SO DICKING OVERVETERANS ISN'T A BUG OF
THE PROGRAM, IT IS A FEATUREOF THE PROGRAM.
THEY TOOK A PROGRAM THATBY ALL RIGHTS SHOULD COST
$50 BILLION TO REALLY HELPPEOPLE AND GOT IT DOWN TO
$10 BILLION BY JUST TAKING OUTTHE PEOPLE IT COULD HELP.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'SJUST CONGRESS.
THAT'S JUST WHO THEY ARE.
CONSISTENTLY FINDING THEMOST ECONOMICAL PATH WHEN IT
COMES TO THE MILITARY.
>> THE U.S. SPENDS AS MUCHAS ON DEFENSE AS THE NEXT
TEN COUNTRIES COMBINED.
>> A BILLION DOLLARS ONHELICOPTERS AND PLANES.
>> $3 MILLION.
>> A HALF BILLION.
>> $600 MILLION.>> $12 BILLION.
>> $34 MILLION.>> $60 BILLION.
>> NEVER USED,
>> THE TANKS WEREN'T EVENNEEDED.
>> THEY SIT UNUSED.
>> NEVER USED?>> NEVER USED.
>> CONGRESS WANTS TO GIVETHE AIR FORCE $3.6 BILLION,
THAT IS $175 MILLION MORETHAN THE REQUEST.
>> Jon: I'M SORRY, THE THEYARE THE MOST ECONOMICAL PATH
WHEN IT COMES TO AFTER BEINGIN THE MILITARY.
SEE, IT'S CRAZY.
WHEN THEY NEED VETERANS TOFIGHT WARS, NO TIME OR
EXPENSE IS AN OPTION.
I MEAN, JEEZ, YOU REMEMBER HOWFAR AND WIDE THEY WENT TO FIND
RAMBO.
THEY CHASED HIM INTO THEWOODS.
THEY FOUND HIM IN A PRISON.
THEY GOT A [BLEEP] MONESTARYIN THAILAND.
THAT'S LIKE-- THAILAND,THAT'S MORE THAN 40 MILES AS
THE CROW FLIES.
WHEN HE CAME BACK, COULDN'TGET [BLEEP] COUNSELLING
THOUGH.
YEAH, NO, COULDN'T GETCOUNSELLING.
IT WAS DENIED.
IT TURNS OUT WHEN IT COMESTO VETERANS, CONGRESS ARE
JUST DEADBEAT DADS.
THEY WILL SPEND A TREMENDOUSAMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY TO
GET A CHANCE TO UNLOAD THEAMMUNITION.
ONCE THEY BLOW THAT LOAD,AND IT CAUSES PEOPLE TO TAKE
CARE OF, NO, NO, NO, BABY,JUST LET YOURSELF OUT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
