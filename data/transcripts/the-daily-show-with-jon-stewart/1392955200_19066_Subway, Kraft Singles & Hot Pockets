INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED CHEESESLICES.
THEY ARE REPLACING THE ASORBICACID WITH SOMETHING THEY SAY IS
A NATURAL MOLD INHIBITOR.

A MOLD INHIBITOR.
KRAFT AMERICAN SINGLES DON'TNEED MOLD INHIBITORS THEY DON'T
GO BAD BY DEFINITION BECAUSETHEY ARE AMERICAN.

HOT POCKETS.

RECALLED BEEF.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD!
I HAD NO IDEA THEY PUT ACTUALBEEF IN THESE.
[ LAUGHTER ]I THOUGHT THE INSIDES WERE JUST
STUFF THEY FOUND IN THEIRPOCKETS.
[LAUGHTER]MAYBE IT'S NOT THE VARIETY OF
HOT POCKET THAT I BUY.
MAYBE THAT HASN'T BEEN RECALLED.
MAYBE IT WAS JUST THE QUESOCHICKEN VARIETY OR BBQ WITH
CHICKEN VARIETY OR PEPPERONIPIZZA VARIETY OR THE NEW HAM AND
BOTTLE CAPS OR LINT AND CANADIANPENNY AS LONG AS IT'S NOT MY
DARLING PHILLY CHEESE STEAK.

TO BEAT THE [BLEEP] OUT OF. HOWABOUT YOU COME OVER HERE ANDI'LL BEAT YOUR (bleep) FRENCH
ASS.
THAT'S SORT OF A PHILADELPHIAACCENT.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS BEEF?
>> THEY MAY CONTAIN MEAT FROMRANCHO FEEDING CORPORATION WHICH
IS RECALLING NEARLY 9 MILLIONPOUNDS BEEF THAT REGULATORS SAY
CAME FROM DISEASED AND UNSOUNDANIMALS.
>> Jon: UNSOUND.
UNSOUND COWS, COWS LOSING THEIRMARBLES.
