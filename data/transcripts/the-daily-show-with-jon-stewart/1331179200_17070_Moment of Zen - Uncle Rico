JOIN US TOMORROW NIGHT AT 11:00.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THERE IS
NOTHING LIKE AT 11:20 AT NIGHT A
NICE LITTLE FAMILY PLANNING
CONVERSATION WHILE YOU'RE AT
HOME [BLEEPED] YOUR BRAINS OUT
TO THE TV.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WE'RE ALL
LUCKY IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT
LEROY JENKINS DIDN'T COME
BARGING IN.
LEROY JENKINS!
HERE IT IS, YOUR MOMENT OF ZEN.
>> IT WAS JUST ODD.
IT FELT LIKE UNCLE RICO IN
NAPOLEON DYNAMITE?
>> WHICH ONE WAS UNCLE RICO?
>> THE GUY WITH THE HAIR PARTED
IN THE MIDDLE AND HE WAS
CONSTANTLY THROWING PASSES,
TALKING ABOUT HIS HIGH SCHOOL
FOOTBALL CAREER, NOT WORKING.
