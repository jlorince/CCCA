(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK, MY
GUEST ACADEMY AWARD WINNER,HIS NEW FILM IS CALLED THE
BOOK THIEF.
>> ARE YOU SICK.
>> I'M FINE.
>> WHAT IS THE MATTER.
>> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
>> SORRY, PAPA.
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL MAMMA?
PAPA?
>> DID ANYONE SEE YOU?
LET'S MAKE THIS OUR SECRET.
>> Jon: A SPOILER ALERT,HITLER DIES IN THE END.
PLEASE WELCOME GEOFFREYRUSH.
SIR!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: HOW ARE YOU. SIT.
IN OUR COUNTRY THE NORMALPROTOCOL WOULD BE THAT THE
GUEST WOULD SIT AND THEN IWOULD SIT, DOES IT WORK
SIMILARLY IN YOUR LAND.
>> IT'S THE SAME.
>> Jon: THE SAME.
>> YEAH, YEAH.
>> Jon: WE HAVE SO MUCH INCOMMON.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
THIS IS A PHENOMENAL MOVIE.
WONDERFUL MOVIE.
AND YOUR PERFORMANCE IN ITAS ALWAYS, I DON'T-- IT'S
HARD TO ADD MORESUPERLATIVES WONDERFUL.
>> I'M DOING GOOD.
WE'VE BEEN TRAVELING WITHTHE FILM THROUGH SOME
FESTIVALS AND GUILD SCREENINGS.
AND WE WENT TO THE MUSEUM OFTOLERANCE IN L.A. AND HAD A
NICE SCREENING THERE.
>> Jon: I IMAGINE THEY DON'TCRITICIZE YOU AFTER A MOVIE
THERE AT THE MUSEUM OFTOLERANCE.
>> THEY WERE BEYONDTOLERANT.
IT WAS GREAT AT THEHOLOCAUST MUSEUM IN
WASHINGTON IT WAS A VERY,VERY SPECIAL NIGHT BECAUSE
THERE WERE QUITE A FEWSURVIVORS IN THE AUDIENCE.
AND I MET A GUY, COME UP TOME AND SAID I WAS 14 DURING
THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND IWAS HIDDEN BY A VERY KINDLY
AVERAGE FARMER JUST ON THEOUTSKIRTS OF PARIS FOR THREE
OR FOUR YEARS.
AND HE REMINDED ME, YOURCHARACTER IN THE FILM
REMINDED ME SO MUCH OF HIM.
AND THIS GUY IS NOW IN HISLATE 80s I WOULD IMAGINE.
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHATHE'S BEEN THROUGH.
>> Jon: THAT'S AMAZING.
THAT'S GOT TO MAKE YOU FEELIN SOME WAY LIKE JUST
INCREDIBLY MOVED TO EVENHAVE DONE IT, TO EVEN HAVE
PUT THE FILM OUT.
BECAUSE I IMAGINE THEIRRESPONSE TO IT IS ALMOST
MORE MEANINGFUL THANANYTHING ELSE.
>> YEAH, WELL, AT THATMUSEUM, I HAD A BIG EXHIBITION
ON AT THE TIME ABOUTCOMPLICITY AND THE KIND OF
PRESSURES THAT PEOPLE WEREUNDER, IN VERY REMOTE GERMAN
TOWNS AS THE NATIONALSOCIALISTS WERE, YOU KNOW,
REALLY PUTTING, REALLYEATING INTO THE PEOPLE'S
LIVES.
AND YOU KNOW, NEIGHBORS,SOMETIMES GOT TERRORIZED,
WERE FEARFUL, WENT FORSELF-PRESERVATION RATHER
THAN A MORE HUMANE ETHICALKIND OF RESPONSE.
>> Jon: THE MORAL RESPONSEYOU WOULD THINK, WHERE DID
YOU FILL TESTIMONY, DID YOUFILM IT HERE?
>> WE WERE, IT WAS GREAT FORME AS AN ACTOR.
WE WERE AT THE HISTORICSTUDIOS IN BERLIN WHICH IS
WHERE.
>> Jon: WOW.
>> IN THE OLD DAYS THE YOUNGBILLY WILDER, LUBICH.
>> Jon: RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> ALL THOSE LONG FORGOTTENGERMAN FILMMAKERS, TARANTINO
WORKED THERE WITH INGLORIOUSBASTARDS.
>> Jon: HOW DID THEYRESPOND.
WAS THAT ON A SOUNDSTAGE ORARE YOU ON A STREET AND THEY
DRESSED THE STREET AND DOLOCAL PEOPLE GO WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO.
>> KIND OF BECAUSE ALL THENAZI STUFF IS NOW BANNED,
SO IT'S PRETTY HARD TO GETSWASTIKAS OUT AND BE SINGING
THE ORIGINAL LYRICS TOUBERALIS.
AND.
>> Jon: I IMAGINE TOO THATTHEY MIGHT THINK THAT A
MOVIE IS NOT THE THING THATTHEY WANT TO BE-- TO BE
REMINDED.
>> BERLIN IS, I HAD AFANTASTIC TIME THERE BECAUSE
WE HAD A PREDOMINANTLYGERMAN CREW AND FANTASTIC
GERMAN ACTOR, SO IT WASLIKE A REALLY SERIOUS
IMMERSION INTO HOW THEY'VECOME OUT OF AND ARE WRESTLING
WITH PROBABLY THE WORSTCENTURY THAT A COUNTRY COULD
GO THROUGH.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
I ALWAYS WONDER ABOUT THAT.
HOW A COUNTRY, WHEN YOU HAVESOMETHING THAT IS, THAT YOUR
COUNTRY HAS DONE THAT ISWITHOUT QUESTION EVIL,
COUNTRYMEN THAT WERECOMPLICIT IN IT BUT MAYBE
YOU WERE NOT DIRECTLY ORYOUR FAMILY WASN'T, DO YOU
BEGIN TO GET RESENTFUL, IALWAYS WONDER THAT WITH THE
BACKLASH AGAINST, IN THISCOUNTRY, ABOUT LIKE SLAVERY
OR NATIVE AMERICAN, WHATWE'VE DONE, PEOPLE SAYING
WELL THAT WASN'T ME, IWASN'T THERE.
IS THERE BACKLASH?
>> WE'RE PROBABLY GETTINGFROM ALL ANGLES IN THE
RESPONSE TO THE FILM WHICHIS, IT SEEMED, I MEAN AS AN
ACTOR I USED TO BE A STAGEACTOR I LIKED GOING AND
SITTING IN WITH SOMEAUDIENCES, I'VE SAT IN WITH
SOME PUBLIC PERFORMANCES,I'VE SAT IN WITH FESTIVALS.
AND YOU CAN READ THE HOUSE.
IT IS A DEEPLY EMOTIONAL,IT'S A SLOW BUILD OF AN
EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO A VERYDARK CHAPTER BUT THE GREAT
THING SEEMS TO BE THAT ITHAPPENS AT DIFFERENT POINTS
FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
WE'VE TRIED NOT TO BESENTIMENTAL OR MELODRAMATIC
ABOUT IT.
MY AGENTDESCRIBED IT AS A
FIVE HANKER CHIEF MOVIE ANDTHAT WOULD BE PRETTY GOOD
FOR THE POSTER.
BECAUSE IT IS NOTPRESCRIBING HOW YOU SHOULD
HAVE A RESPONSE.
IT'S REALIZING, FROM THEORIGINAL BOOK, WHAT, THE
WHAT THE AUTHOR OF THEBOOK HAS GIVEN US IS A
GREAT GIFT TO HAVE EMPATHYFOR ORDINARY PEOPLE IN GERMANY
WHO WERE SWEPT UP IN THISTERRIBLE KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
INSIDIOUS POLITICAL MAELSTROM.
>> AND HUMANIZING THEIRPLIGHT BECAUSE THAT IS
DIFFICULT TO DO AS WELL.
WHAT A THOUGHTFUL MAN YOUARE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
COMING ON HERE.
I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU'RENOT LIKE THIS NORMALLY.
THAT NORMALLY YOU LIKE TOGET DRUNK ON A BEER KEG
STAND AND -->> I DO.
>> Jon: AN GET IN FISTFIGHTSIN THE STREET.
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUCOMING BY AND TALKING ABOUT
IT.
GEOFFREY RUSH
