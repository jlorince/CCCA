>> Jon: HEY! WELCOME BACK TO THESHOW!
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANTED TO TELLYOU, FOR THE PAST COUPLE NIGHTS,
FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS,WE HAVE NOTICED,
THERE IS A NEW ADVERTISER ON THE"DAILY SHOW" PROGRAM.
NO, IT'S NOT ARBY'S.
THEY KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAYUS FOR THEIR NUMEROUS MENTIONS.
( LAUGHTER )ARBY'S-- FOR WHEN YOU'RE
WONDERING WHAT IT TASTES LIKEWHEN A COW DIES.
( LAUGHTER )ANYWAY, LET'S MEET OUR NEW
SPONSOR.
>> KOCH INDUSTRIES STARTED INTHE HEARTLAND.
WE HELP MAKE BETTER FOOD,CLOTHING, SHELTER, TECHNOLOGY,
AND OTHER NECESSITIES.
WE BUILD ON EACH OTHER'S IDEASTO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.
WE ARE KOCH.
>> Jon:  WOW, THAT'S THEKIND OF AN AD THAT A COMPANY
USUALLY MAKES WHEN IT TURNS OUTA BY-PRODUCT OF THEIR
MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS GIVINGYOUNG PUBESCENT MALES TALKING
NIPPLES.
BUT YOU KNOW, WHO ARE THESELOVABLE SCAMP KOCH BROTHERS?
>> TWO OF THE WORLD'S RICHESTBILLIONAIRES, DAVID KOCH AND HIS
BROTHER, CHARLES, CONTROL KOCHINDUSTRIES, A
GLOBAL ENERGY ANDMANUFACTURING GIANT.
>> Jon:  SO IT'S A FAMILYBUSINESS, KIND A MOM AND POP,
SECOND LARGEST PRIVATELY HELDCORPORATION IN THE COUNTRY.
THE POINT IS THIS, TWO BROTHERSWORKING TOGETHER, I LIKE THAT--
UNLESS, IT'S OBVIOUSLY,THE THEMENENDEZ BROTHERS, AND THEN
IT'S -- THESE ARE NOT THOSEKINDS OF BROTHERS AM I RIGHT?
>> THEY'VE USE THAT WEALTH TOBACK CONSERVATIVE CAUSES.
THE BILLIONAIRE BROTHERS AREEXPECTED TO SPEND SOME $290
MILLION THESE MIDTERMS, MOSTLYTHROUGH THEIR COMPLICATED WEB OF
DARK MONEY ORGANIZATIONS.
>> Jon:  WOW, I CAN SEE WHYTHEY WANT TO PORTRAY THEIR
PEOPLE AS WORKING IN A SMILEFACTORY OR AS BABY TAILGATERS.
( LAUGHTER )"IF YOU CAN SMELL THIS, YOU'RE
TOO CLOSE.
1-800-HOW'S MY POOPY DIAPER?WOW, SO NOW THAT WE KNOW THE
KOCH BROTHER ARE POURING ANUNENDING WATERFALL OF MONEY
THROUGH A CLEVERLY MASKEDNETWORK OF UNACCOUNTABLE
ORGANIZATIONS TO PEDDLEELECTORAL INFLUENCE,
THE AD SOUNDS LESS INSPIRING.
>> WE'VE EXPANDED TO NEARLYEVERY STATE.
TOGETHER, WE ARE KOCH.
>> Jon:  ALL THOSE WHOAREN'T KOCH WILL BE ASSIGNED TO
DISTRICT "B."
THE POINT IS, CLEARLY, THE KOCHBROTHERS ARE TRYING TO SAY TO
OUR AUDIENCE OFNOT-YET-DYING-OFF VOTERS, EVEN
THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE HEARDCERTAIN THINGS ABOUT THE KOCH
BROTHERS, HOW BAD COULD THEY BE?
I MEAN, IF THEY WERE EVIL,WOULD A BABY AGREE TO APPEAR IN
ONE OF THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS?
( LAUGHTER )BUT, OF COURSE, THEIR AD DID
LEAVE OUT A COUPLE OF VERY, VERYSMALL POINTS, MOST LIKELY FOR
LACK OF TIME.
SO TO WELCOME THEM TO THE THE"DAILY SHOW" ADVERTISING FAMILY,
WE DID MAKE SOME MINORADJUSTMENTS.
>> WE'RE KOCH INDUSTRIES, NOTJUST AN ENERGY COMPANY, WE'RE IN
YOUR FOOD, IN YOUR PANTS, AND INYOUR HOME.
AND IF THERE'S A WAY TO MONETIZEYOUR THOUGHTS, WE'LL FIND IT.
ALL WHILE BACKING 17 SHADOWORGANIZATIONS TO BUY ELECTIONS
FROM PENNSYLVANIA AVE. TO MAINSTREET.
YOU WON'T ALWAYS SEE OUR NAMESON OUR CAMPAIGN ADS BECAUSE THE
POLITICIANS WE OWN SAY THAT'SOKAY.
WITH OUR HEARTFELT DEVOTION TOFOSSIL FUELS, WE MAKE YOUR
PLANET WARMER, AND YOUR WATERMORE FLAMMABLE, WHILE
LUBRICATING YOUR BIRDS, ANDREARRANGING YOUR POLAR BEARS.
WE CAN'T RAISE YOUR LITTLE GIRLFOR YOU, BUT WE CAN HAND PICK
HER SCHOOL BOARD, AND APPROVEHER TEXT BOOKS.
AND WHEN SHE LANDS HER FIRSTJOB, WE'LL BE FIGHTING TO REDUCE
THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE WEACTUALLY BELIEVE IT COULD LEAD
TO NAZISM.
YEAH, NAZISM.
WE'RE THAT ( BLEEP ) OUT THERE.
WE'RE KOCH INDUSTRIES, THE NEXTGENERATION OF ROBBER BARONS
BENDING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESSTO OUR WILL SINCE 1980.
OH, AND OUR BROTHER DAVID LIKESBALLET.
