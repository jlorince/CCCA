NAUSEOUS?
(LAUGHTER)
THE SEASON OF FISCAL DISCIPLINE.
HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE
DISCOVERING CUTTING SPENDING
ISN'T AS EASY AS THEY HOPED.
IT TURNS OUT PEOPLE LIKE SOME OF
THE THINGS GOVERNMENT DOES FOR
THEM.
LUCKILY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE
COME UP WITH A BRILLIANT IDEA.
WHAT IF INSTEAD OF CULTING
SERVICES FOR POOR PEOPLE, THEY
CUT SERVICES FOR WOMEN?
>> $747 MILLION IN CUTS TO THE
NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN,
INFANTS, AND CHILDREN.
>> CUTTING MORE THAN A BILLION
DOLLARS FROM THE HEAD START
EDUCATION PROGRAM.
>> ONE OF THE BILLS ELIMINATES
TAX BREAKS FOR PRIVATE EMPLOYERS
WHO PROVIDE HEALTH COVERAGE IF
THEIR PLANS OFFER ABORTION
SERVICES.
>> ALLOWING HOSPITALS TO REFUSE
TO PERFORM AN ABORTION ON A
WOMAN EVEN IF SHE'LL DIE.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
(BOOS)
>> Jon: WOW, THAT'S SO PRO-LIFE
EVEN IF IT KILLS YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
SO THEY WANT TO CUT EVERYTHING
FROM FAMILY CARE TO PRENATAL
CARE TO...
(LAUGHTER)
CHILD NUTRITION.
IT'S LIKE THE REPUBLICANS ARE
SAYING YOU CAN'T PREVENT AN
UNWANTED CHILD, YOU CAN'T GET
CARE IF YOU DO GET PREGNANT AND
WE WON'T GIVE YOU ANY HELP
FEEDING THE KID AFTER IT'S BORN.
BUT THOSE TWO MINUTES WHEN THAT
SKULL IS CROWNING, YOUR BABY'S
THE MOST PRECIOUS THING ON
EARTH.
(LAUGHTER)
MUCH OF THE G.O.P. FOCUS IS ON
PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHICH, TO
HEAR THEM TELL IT, IS APPARENTLY
IN THE ABORTION BUSINESS FOR AN
UNUSUAL REASON.
>> PLANNED PARENTHOOD ISN'T
ABOUT HEALTH, IT'S ABOUT PROFIT.
THEIR FOCUS ON BECOMING BIG
BUSINESS.
>> THEY REPORTED A $63 BILLION
PROFIT.
>> THEY MAKE MONEY ON THE
ABORTIONS.
>> Jon: THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
EVERYONE KNOWS PLANNED
PARENTHOOD DOESN'T MAKE MONEY ON
THE ABORTIONS.
IT'S THE CONCESSIONS.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS.
YOUR JUNIOR MINTS, YOUR NACHOS.
WHO NEEDS THAT BIG A DRINK TO GO
IN?
PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S INSIDIOUS
PROFITEERING DOES NOT END THERE.
>> THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD
OPERATION IN MY STATE OF
MINNESOTA SAID THEY RECENTLY
OPENED THREE EXPRESS CENTERS IN
WELLESLEY MINNESOTA... WEALTHY
MINNESOTA SUBURBS AND SHOPPING
CENTERS AND MALLS AND PLACES
WHERE WOMEN ARE ALREADY DOING
THEIR GROCERY SHOPPING, PICKING
UP STARBUCKS, LIVING THEIR DAILY
LIVES AND STOPPING OFF FOR AN
ABORTION.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: SOME OF THEM AREN'T EVEN
PREGNANT.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S JUST SO DAMN CONVENIENT.
IT'S LIKE THEM ANTIANN'S PREL
SETHS.
YOU'RE NOT PLANS ON EATING ONE
BUT IT'S RIGHT ACROSS FROM
ABERCROMBIE.
I HAD NO IDEA WHY SO MANY... SO
MANY MALL ABORTIONS WERE GOING
ON.
IS THAT WHY STORES HAVE THOSE
NAMES LIKE LINENS AND THINGS,
BED BATH & BEYOND DAVID AND...
NOW, THE VAST MAJORITY OF
PLANNED PARENTHOOD SERVICES ARE
NON-ABORTION RELATED.
THERE'S ALREADY A LAW IN PLACE
TO HIDE AMENDMENTS THAT ENSURES
NONE OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING IT
RECEIVES TO K GO TOWARDS
ABORTIONS.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
>> PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND ITS
DEFENDERS WILL CLAIM THE MONEY
THEY'VE RECEIVED FROM THE
GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN USED TO
FUND ABORTIONS.
BUT THAT'S ONLY TECHNICALLY
TRUE.
>> Jon: YES, TECHNICALLY TRUE.
ALSO KNOWN AS TRUE.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT GO ON.
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION THE
TAXPAYER DOLLARS RECEIVED BY
PLANNED PARENTHOOD ARE USED TO
COVER ALLOWED EXPENSES LIKE
OVERHEAD, OPERATIONAL COSTS,
THUS FREEING UP OTHER MONEY FOR
THE CLINICS THAT DO PROVIDE
ABORTIONS.
>> IT'S LIKE A SHELL GAME.
EXCEPT INSTEAD OF A BALL
UNDERNEATH A WALNUT SHELL IT'S
WOMB INSTEAD OF...
