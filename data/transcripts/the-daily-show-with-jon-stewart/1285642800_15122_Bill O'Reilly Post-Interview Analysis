THANKS AGAIN TO BILL O'REILLY.
THANKS TO BILL O'REILLY FOR
COMING ON THE PROGRAM.
OBVIOUSLY WHEN HE HAS GUESTS
SUCH AS MYSELF ON HIS PROGRAM HE
MAKES A MEAL OF IT.
APPEARS BEFOREHAND ON OTHER FOX
NEWS SHOWS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS
GOING ON TO HAPPEN -- GOING TO
HAPPEN.
THERE'S THE INTERVIEW ITSELF,
BERNIE GOLDBERG'S CRA MIEWJON
CORNER.
>> THERE'S POWER.
>> HE DID VERY WELL AND I LOOKED
LIKE A COMPLETE IDIOT.
>> YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE POWER BUT
HE HELD HIS OWN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: TO BE FAIR I WAS ONLY
DOING THAT BECAUSE I LIKE DOING
THIS.
WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE GOOSE DBRK
FOR THE GANDER.
I'M JOINED BY OUR POST INTERVIEW
ANALYSTS OLIVIA AND JOHN OLIVER.
I'M GOING TO START WITH OLIVIA.
OLIVIA, YOU ARE OUR BODY
LANGUAGE EXPERT.
HOW DID I DO?
DID I PUT THE SMACKDOWN ON HIM?
WAS I AGGRESSIVE?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> EARTH, JON, I'M NOT A BODY
LANGUAGE EXPERT I'M A BODY SIZE
EXPERT.
YOU NOTICED BILL O'REILLY IS
MUCH, MUCH TALLER THAN YOU.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SAYING NOTHING OF HIS OVERALL
MASS.
>> Jon: HE IS BIGGER THAN I
AM.
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE THE
SIZE OF THE PERSON IN THE
INTERVIEW?
IT DOESN'T --
>> YEAH, USUALLY IT DOESN'T BUT
IN THIS CASE WHEN ONE IS SO MUCH
LARGER, IT TIPS THE DEBATE
SCALE.
SORRY, IT WAS HARD NOT TO
IMAGINE BILL O'REILLY CARRYING
YOU AROUND IN A BABY BJORN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> COULD I JUST BUST IN HERE.
>> Jon: SURE, THAT WOULD BE
FINE.
>> NOW THE QUESTION IS, WHAT
DOES THIS SIZE DIFFERENCE MEAN
FOR THE MID TERM ELECTIONS.
>> Jon: WHAT DO THE MID TERM
ELECTIONS HAVE TO DO WITH ANY OF
THIS.
>> THIS WAS A PROXY WAR WITH
BILL O'REILLY REPRESENTING THE
REPUBLICANS AND YOU REPRESENTING
THE DEMOCRATS.
O'REILLY WAS POWERFUL AND
IMPOSING.
WHEREAS YOU WERE COWERING,
INSECT LIKE.
>> LIKE A LITTLE LADYBUG, A
TEENY TINY LADYBUG.
>> O'REILLY HAD THAT LOW
REGISTER OF AUTHORITY TO YOUR
VOICE.
COME ON, STEWART, YOU KNOW
REGULAR FOLKS HATE YOU, RIGHT?
>> WHEN YOU SPOKE IT WAS LIKE
BEEP BEEP BEEP.
>> YOUR HIGH PITCHED GIRLY
ANTICS PROBABLY COST THE
DEMOCRATS A SENATE SEAT IN
COLORADO.
WELL DONE ON THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
>> IF YOU WERE JUST LIKE SIX
INCHES TALLER AND LIKE LESS
ESTROGEN IN YOUR BODY, EVERY
AMERICAN WOULD PROBABLY HAVE
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE RIGHT
NOW.
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT FAIR.
>> IT'S TRUE.
>> AH, DON'T FEEL BAD, LITTLE
GIRL.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT THAT --
>> HEY, LOOK AT THIS, I GOT A
LITTLE DOLL FOR YOU RIGHT HERE.
YOU LIKE THAT?
WILL THAT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
>> HERE THERE YOU GO.
>> Jon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH I
APPRECIATE THAT.
>> WOW.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
>> YOU ARE TALL.
YOU ARE VERY TALL.
>> YOU ARE A TINY MAN.
>> YOU ARE A LITTLE MAN.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD.
