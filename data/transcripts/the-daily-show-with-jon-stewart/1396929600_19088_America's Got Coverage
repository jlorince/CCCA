AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ENROLLMENTDEADLINE.
IT WAS A CRUCIAL TEST FOR THEOBAMA ADMINISTRATION THEY SET AN
AMBITIOUS GOAL LAST SEPTEMBER.

THEY EXPECT TO GET THREE MOREMILLION IN ONE MONTH. WOW,
THIS IS GOING TO BE A DISASTER.

THESE NUMBERS.
>> THIS IS A SHAM.
>> I THINK THEY ARE COOKING THEBOOKS ON THIS.
>> Jon: IF I KNOW THISADMINISTRATION THEY ARE PROBABLYSTEAMING
THE BOOKS INSTEAD OF COOING THEMWITH OIL OR BUTTER.
MIGHT GIVE THE BOOKS SOMEFLAVOR, AND THEY'RE PROBABLY
SERVING MACROBIOTIC KALE WITHTHE BOOKS.

MIDDLE EASTERN HONEY PASTRY WITHFLAXSEED THAT NOBODY LIKES AND
