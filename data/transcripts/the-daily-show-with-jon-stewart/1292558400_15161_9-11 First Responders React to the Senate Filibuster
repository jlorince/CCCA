SHOW.
TALK ABOUT THE EMOTIONS NOW
GOING ON IN THE SENATE, WE'RE
JOINED BY FOUR MEN WHO CAN BEST
SYMPATHIZE WITH WHAT THE SENATE
IS GOING THROUGH.
PLEASE WELCOME KENNY SPECK,
CHRIS BROWMAN, N.Y.P.D., KEN
GEORGE AND JOHN DEVLIN,
OPERATING ENGINEER OF HEAVY
EQUIPMENT, ALL 9/11 FIRST
RESPONDERS.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
GENTLEMEN, YOU'RE ALL 9/11 FIRST
RESPONDERS.
YOU WERE DOWN THERE FROM THE
MOMENT OF THE ATTACK.
FOR THE MOST PART.
NOW YOU SEE THE SENATE IS
FILIBUSTERING THE BILL.
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND
AS YOU'RE WATCHING THIS PROCESS
GO DOWN?
>> WE'RE DISGUSTED.
WE'RE DISAPPOINTED.
AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE HURT.
WE ARE PROUD PROTECTORS OF THE
CONSTITUTION FOR THE PEOPLE, BY
THE PEOPLE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND WE WANT TO KNOW WHERE IT
WAS LOST.
>> WE'RE PATRIOTS TO THIS
COUNTRY.
IT'S LIKE EVERYBODY HERE.
WE WENT DOWN THERE FOR THE LOVE
OF THIS COUNTRY AND FOR THE LOVE
OF OUR CITY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE DIDN'T TURN OUR BACK ON
ANYBODY.
FOR US TO BE HERE NOW, NINE
YEARS LATER, STILL FIGHTING JUST
FOR OUR HEALTH, FOR OUR
COMPENSATION.
>> Jon: YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM
STAGE FOUR THROAT CANCER.
>> STAGE FOUR INOPERABLE THROAT
CANCER ON BOTH LYMPH NODES.
>> Jon: AND YOU'RE SUFFERING
FROM...
>> I GOT HEART DISEASE AND LUNG
DISEASE.
>> Jon: FROM BEING DOWN THERE.
>> FROM BEING DOWN THERE.
>> HEART, LUNG, BRAIN ISSUES.
>> CANCER.
>> Jon: AND THESE ARE ALL FROM
BEING DOWN THERE?
>> DEFINITELY.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, NONE OF THE
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WENT ON THE
FLOOR OF THE SENATE TO TALK
ABOUT WHY THEY WERE GOING TO
FILIBUSTER THE BILL, BUT SENATOR
MITCH McCONNELL A COUPLE DAYS
AGO DID ACTUALLY GET ON THE
FLOOR OF THE SENATE AND MADE I
THOUGHT A REALLY EMOTIONAL
SPEECH, AND I WANTED YOU GUYS TO
LISTEN TO IT AND MAYBE GET YOUR
REACTIONS TO IT.
>> JUD GREW UP IN NASHUA IN
SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
HE FOUND TIME TO DRESS UP AS THE
SCHOOL'S MASCOT FOR A TIME.
IN 1992 JUD DECIDED TO RUN FOR
THE JUST SENATE.
HE'S BEEN INSTRUMENTAL... WHEN
HE WALKS OUT OF THIS CHAMBER FOR
THE LAST TIME, HE'LL LEAVE AN
ENORMOUS VOID BEHIND.
>> Jon: SENATOR MITCH
McCONNELL IS TALKING ABOUT
SENATOR JUDD GREGG WHO IS
RETIRING FROM THE SENATE.
>> HE'S SHEDDING A TEAR ON HIS
LUNCH BUDDY THAT HE HANGS OUT
WITH EVERY DAY.
WHERE IS HIS HUMAN FEELING FOR
NOT ONLY THE FOUR OF US.
WE REPRESENT THE BROTHERS AND
SISTERS THAT WERE DOWN THERE.
THIS ISN'T A ME-ME TO ANY ONE OF
US.
THIS IS ABOUT THE BROTHERS AND
THE SISTERS THAT CAN'T COME OUT
AND SPEAK LIKE WE CAN.
IT'S SAD TO SEE SOMEONE LIKE
HIM...
>> Jon: TO BE FAIR, THEY HAVE
WORKED TOGETHER FOR LIKE SIX
YEARS.
( LAUGHTER )
>> HE'S CRYING BECAUSE THE OTHER
GUY PAID THE TAB.
THAT'S WHAT HE'S CRYING FOR.
>> Jon: REALLY, THAT'S THE
THING, THE GUY WHO PAYS THE
LUNCH TAB.
>> WATCHING THAT, THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING I CAN SAY.
I FOUND TIME TO DRESS AS A NEW
YORK CITY FIREMAN ON SEPTEMBER
11th.
ISN'T THAT INCREDIBLE.
>> Jon: THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
YOU WERE ABLE TO PULL THAT OFF.
STUNNING.
>> I FEEL BAD FOR MITCH
McCONNELL.
YOU KNOW, HE SAID SOMETHING VERY
IMPORTANT, THAT HIS FRIEND, HE'S
GOING TO WATCH HITS FRIEND WALK
OUT OF THE SENATE CHAMBERS, AND
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S MORE THAN A
NEW YORK CITY FIREFIGHTER CAN
SAY ABOUT 343 OF HIS BROTHERS
WHO CAN'T WALK ANYMORE.
>> HAS HE BEEN TO ONE 9/11
FUNERAL?
>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS THE STRANGE THING.
NOW LET ME JUST... I DO THINK
THERE'S MISPERCEPTIONS THAT
BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF UNIONS,
YOU'RE ALREADY COVERED FOR ALL
THIS STUFF, BUT EXPLAIN, THE WAY
I'VE HEARD IT IS YOU GUYS GO
DOWN TO 9/11.
YOU'RE THERE BASICALLY FROM THE
DAY THE ATTACK STRAIGHT THROUGH,
DIGGING PEOPLE OUT, I MEAN,
GOING THROUGH HORRIFIC THINGS
THAT MANY OF US CANNOT EVER...
>> TEN MONTHS, SEVEN DAYS A
WEEK, 12 HOURS A DAY WE WERE
DOWN THERE BREATHING IN ALL
THAT.
LIKE 1,000 TOXICITIES DOWN
THERE.
>> Jon: SO YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH ALL.
THIS WHEN YOU GET SICK, THEY
CONSIDER IT WORKMAN'S COMP.
YOU CAN'T WORK ANYMORE, SO YOUR
INSURANCE SUDDENLY IS CUT, AND
THE WORKMAN'S COMP PEOPLE FIGHT
YOU.
>> IT'S WORK RELATED.
>> Jon: BECAUSE THEY SAY, HOW
CAN WE DECIDE YOUR CANCERS ARE
WORK RELATED.
>> I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF.
I'M FIGHTING THIS CANCER LAST
YEAR.
WHILE I'M FIGHTING FOR THE
CANCER, I WAS FIGHTING FOR THE
COMPENSATION THAT WOULD COVER MY
BILLS.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
>> Jon: HOW COME N.Y.P.D.
DOESN'T... DOES N.Y.P.D. COVER
ALL OF YOUR STUFF?
HOW DOES THAT WORK?
>> THEY PUT ME OUT ON
THREE-QUARTERS.
I GOT A PHONE CALL ONE DAY, AND
THEY TOLD MY WIFE THEY WERE
PUTTING ME OUT BECAUSE I WAS
COSTING N.Y.P.D. TOO MUCH.
AT THAT POINT I WAS "STILL ON
THE JOB," BUT I'M SICK.
>> Jon: IT'S A HEALTH BURDEN
BUT ALSO FINANCIAL BURDEN.
>> IT IS.
EXACTLY.
THEY DON'T CARE.
>> WE HAVE COVERAGE, BUT CO-PAYS
RUN ME A COUPLE HUNDRED A MONTH.
IF I GET REALLY SICK...
>> Jon: AND YOU HAD A BUDDY
DIGEST THIS WEEK OR LAST WEEK.
>> FACE CANCER.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S... HE HAD
A PROS TETIC NOSE.
HIS NOSE, HIS NOSE FELL OFF HIS
FACE.
>> Jon: HE DIED OF THIS
CANCER?
>> YOU CAN'T TELL A REASONABLE
PERSON THAT WHEN YOUR NOSE FALLS
OFF YOUR FACE YOU HAVE NOT DIED
FROM SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY
HORRIFIC THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST
NOT FAMILIAR WITH.
>>
>> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS, THEY
SAY, YOU GOT CANCERMENT WHY IT
IS DUE TO 9/11, OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE CANCER.
BUT THE MAJORITY OF US ARE
HAVING HEART CANCER, RESPIRATORY
PROBLEMS.
>> WE'RE PENALIZED FOR GETTING
SICK.
>> Jon: PEOPLE ARE SAYING,
HEY, MAN, IT'S CHRISTMAS.
THEY'RE SAYING THEY DON'T HAVE
TIME TO GET TO THIS.
THIS IS JON KYL TALKING ABOUT
HARRY REID WANTS THEM TO STAY
AND WORK THAT WEEK BETWEEN
CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S.
LISTEN TO THIS.
>> IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO ALL OF
THE THINGS THE MAJORITY LEADER
LAID OUT WITHOUT DOING FRANKLY
WHITE HOUSE DISRESPECTING THE
INSTITUTION AND WITHOUT
DISRESPECTING ONE OF THE TWO
HOLIEST OF HOLIDAYS FOR
CHRISTIANS AND THE FAMILIES OF
ALL OF THE SENATE, NOT JUST THE
SENATORS THEMSELVES BUT ALL OF
THE STAFF.
>> Jon: BASICALLY WHAT HE'S
SAYING IS I CAN'T STAY HERE AND
WORK BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW
YEAR'S, THAT WOULD BE
DISRESPECTING CHRISTIANS AND HIS
FAMILY.
DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON
THAT?
>> IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THE
DISCONNECT BETWEEN THOSE WE
ELECT TO REPRESENT US AND THOSE
THAT GET OUT THERE AND DO THE
WORK BECAUSE I E-MAIL HERE TO
SAY THAT YOU WON'T FIND A SINGLE
NEW YORK CITY FIREFIGHTER WHO
CONSIDERS IT A SIGN OF
DISRESPECT TO WORK IN A NEW YORK
CITY FIRE HOUSE ON CHRISTMAS YVE
OR CHRISTMAS DAY.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND POLICE
DEPARTMENT DIDN'T SHOW UP AT
THAT TIME?
>> I REPRESENT THE UNION
TRADESMEN IN THIS CITY, AND IT
WAS AN HONOR TO WORK THROUGH
CHRISTMAS ON THAT 9/11 TO GIVE
THAT CLOSURE TO THOSE PEOPLE
THAT WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THAT GATE EVERY MORNING SHOWING
US THEIR PICTURES OF THEIR LOVED
ONES.
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING
BETTER THAN TO GO OUT THERE AND
HELP OTHER PEOPLE.
>> WHAT WOULD THE FAMILIES THINK
OF US IF WE DIDN'T DO OUR JOB
FOR THEM?
>> Jon: ON 9/11, WHEN YOU
HEARD THE TOWERS GOT HIT AND YOU
WERE WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES AND
N.Y.P.D. AND THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT, WHEN YOU GUYS VOTED,
OBVIOUSLY YOU NEEDED A SUPER
MAJORITY TO VOTE TO GO DOWN
THERE, RIGHT?
YOU VOTE.
YOU NEED A SUPER MAJORITY.
( LAUGHTER )
>> BY ONE VOTE WE GOT IT.
>> Jon: DID YOU HAVE TO
PROMISE THINGS TO THE OTHER
FIREFIGHTERS OR OTHER POLICEMEN,
LIKE JUST VOTE WITH US ON THIS
TO GO DOWN TO THE TOWERS TO SAVE
PEOPLE AND WE'LL HAVE CHILI ON
FRIDAY NIGHT?
( LAUGHTER )
>> NOBODY RETIRED THAT DAY,
OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN
CRYING ABOUT THEIR RETIREMENT.
>> Jon: IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A
VERY DIFFICULT DAY FOR YOU.
VERY HARD.
GENTLEMEN, I CANNOT THANK YOU
ENOUGH.
I FEEL LIKE APOLOGIZEING TO ALL
OF YOU AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE
WHY.
IT IS AN ABSOLUTE TRAVESTY.
I APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE, AND
I'M REALLY HOPING THAT THIS IS A
GOOD CHRISTMAS FOR YOU GUYS
BECAUSE YOU CERTAINLY DESERVE IT
MORE THAN ANYBODY.
>> THANK YOU.
