MY GUEST TONIGHT, AN AUTHORWHOSE LATEST BOOK, "HOW WE
GOT TO NOW: SIX INNOVATIONS THATMADE THE MODERN WORLD."
IT WILL ALSO BE ASIX-PART SERIES ON PBS
IN OCTOBER. PLEASE WELCOME BACKTO THE PROGRAM,
STEPHEN JOHNSON!(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: THANK YOUFOR BEING HERE!
>> AH, MY PLEASURE.>> Jon: HERE'S WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT THIS, IT'S AN INNOVATIVEWAY TO TALK ABOUT HISTORY IN A
WAY THAT WE DON'T DO.>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: THAT IT'S NOT LINEAR.
IT LOOKS AT IT FROM A MACROPERSPECTIVE.
>> YEAH, WHAT WE TRIED TO DOWITH BOTH THE SHOW AND THE BOOK
IS TO START WITH THESEBASIC OBJECTS WE TAKE FOR
GRANTED IN THE MODERN WORLD,LIKE A GLASS OF CLEAN DRINKING
WATER.>> Jon: YES.
>> RIGHT? WE ASSUME WE CAN JUSTGO OVER TO THE SPOUT AND GET
WATER AND IT WON'T KILL US WITHCHOLERA OR TYPHOID
48 HOURS LATER, RIGHT?
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> MOST OF US DO.
>> AND YET, BEHIND THAT ORDINARYOBJECT, THERE'S A 500-YEAR OF
HISTORY OF INNOVATIONS ANDIDEAS AND CREATIVITY THAT
CAME TOGETHER TOMAKE THAT POSSIBLE AND ALL THESE
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OFTHOSE INNOVATIONS.
AND IT'S JUST A , NORMALLY WETELL HISTORY IN TERMS
OF GREAT MILITARY LEADERS ORPRESIDENTS OR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND THE HISTORY OF ALL THESE
OBJECTS IS IN A WAY JUST ASINTERESTING, I THINK.
>> Jon: AND ALSO NORMALLY, YOUWOULD SEE IT AS A CHRONOLOGY AND
YOU MAKE THE CONNECTIONSAS IT GOES ON. BUT WHAT'S NICE
ABOUT IT IS IT'S LAIDOUT SORT OF ELEMENTALLY,
COLD, LIGHT, YOU KNOW, WATER.
>> YEAH.
>> Jon: AND YOU ALWAYS IMAGINETHAT A SCIENTIST BUILDS EXACTLY
ON THE LINEAR DISCOVERY RIGHTBEFORE HIS,
BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK THATWAY.
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. AND THEREARE ALL THINGS WE DON'T THINK
ABOUT AS PROBLEMS. SO, WE'VEGOT A CHAPTER AND AN EPISODE
ON TIME AND CLOCKS.
>> Jon: YES.
>> SO UNTIL THE LATE 1870s,EVERY TOWN IN AMERICA WAS ON ITS
OWN TIME. SO YOU WOULD BEONE TOWN IT WOULD BE 8:55,
YOU'D GO TWO TOWNSOVER IT'D BE 8:57,
THREE TOWNS OVER THE OTHER WAYIT'D BE 9:03.
>> Jon: NO ONE SYNCHRONIZED THEWATCHES.
>> NO ONE WOULD SYNCHRONIZE, ANDTHE THING THAT'S COOL ABOUT IT
IS NO ONE EVEN NOTICED THAT THISWAS A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
HAVE ANY NEED TO KIND OF BE THATCOORDINATED IN TERMS OF TIME.
AND THEN THE RAILROADS CAMEALONG. AND SUDDENLY PEOPLE
WERE LEAVING ONE TOWN AT THISTIME, SHOWING UP AT ANOTHER TOWN
THIRTY MINUTES LATER AT ACOMPLETELY DIFFERENT TIME
EXCEPT THE RAILROAD THEY WERE ONWAS ACTUALLY ON BALTIMORE TIME.
AND SO THEY HAD NO IDEA WHATTIME IT WAS ANYMORE. IT WAS JUST
COMPLETELY CONFUSING. AND SOSOMEONE HAD TO
INVENT STANDARDIZED TIME ZONESAND COORDINATE ALL THE CLOCKS
ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY TO MAKETHIS POSSIBLE. AND WE DON'T, I
MEAN, WE NEVER THINK OFSTANDARDIZED TIME AS
SOMETHING THAT WAS EVENAN INVENTION.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> BUT ACTUALLY THERE WAS
A PERSON WILLIAM  ALLEN THATCAME UP WITH IT.
AND WHAT IT MADE POSSIBLE IN THENEXT CENTURY IS THIS, RIGHT?
YOU CAN'T SAY TUNE IN -->> YOUR TiV0, YOUR D.V.R.
>> YOU CAN'T SAY TUNE IN AT11:00 P.M....
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> EASTERN TIME FOR A
SHOW OR A RADIO PROGRAM WITHOUTSTANDARDIZED TIME.
>> Jon: RIGHT. EVEN NOW WITHIN,AS YOU SEE THE DISPARITY
BETWEEN CULTURES, THERE ARECULTURES STILL THAT CANNOT
TAKE FOR GRANTED A GLASS OFCOOL, CLEAN WATER.
>> YEP. ABSOLUTELY.AND I THINK WE REALLY, IT'S
IMPORTANT IN OUR SOCIETY THAT WECELEBRATE THE INNOVATORS THAT
MADE THIS POSSIBLE. RIGHT?WE CELEBRATE INNOVATION ALL THE
TIME IN OUR SOCIETY BUT IT'SALL FOCUSED ON THE 25-YEAR-OLD
BILLIONAIRE OR THE NEW APPLEGADGET AND ALL THESE THINGS ARE
GREAT BUT THE PEOPLE WHO IN THEDEVELOPED WORLD AT LEAST
SOLVED THIS KIND OF PROBLEMARE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE.
WE TELL THIS STORY ABOUTTHIS GUY ELLIS CHESBROUGH
WHO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 19thCENTURY
LIFTED THE CITY OF CHICAGO.IT WAS BASICALLY CHICAGO WAS SO
FLAT THAT IT WOULDN'T DRAINPROPERLY AND SO ALL THIS WASTE
WAS JUST KIND OF ACCUMULATING,AND SO HE HAD THIS IDEA THAT YOU
COULD JUST USE JACK SCREWS -->> Jon: WOULDN'T THEY JUST
PUT IT, DIDN'T THEY USED TO JUSTPUT IT IN THE RIVER, RIGHT?
>> THEY PUT IT IN THE RIVER.
>> Jon: THEY PUT IT IN THERIVER.
>> BUT THEY COULDN'T EVEN GET ITTO THE RIVER.
>> RIGHT.>> AND YOU HAD LIKE PIGS GOING
AROUND AND SCAVENGING. THATWAS THE LIKE WASTE REMOVAL
SYSTEM. >> Jon: RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT.
>> LIKE THESE KIND OF RANDOMPIGS. SO HE FIGURED OUT IF WE
COULD JUST LIFT ALL THEBUILDINGS AND ALL THE STREETS
TEN FEET WE'LL ACTUALLY GET ANICE LITTLE SLOPE THAT WILL
ALLOW THE WASTE ANDEVERYTHING TO FLOW INTO THE
LAKE WHICH WAS ITSELF AKIND OF PROBLEM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND SO HE DID THIS WITH JACKSCREWS.
HE LIFTED UP AN ENTIREHOTEL AT ONE POINT WITH PEOPLE
STAYING IN THE HOTEL AND THEYWOULD MOVE THE BUILDINGS AROUND
AND IT WAS JUST THISEXTRAORDINARY THING.
AND WHEN YOU WALK AROUND CHICAGOTO THIS DAY YOU'RE TEN FEET
ABOVE THE NATURAL LEVELOF THIS CITY BECAUSE OF
THIS BRILLIANT GUY FROM160 YEARS AGO.
>> Jon: WHAT IF I WERE, LET'SSAY I'M A DIFFERENT BRILLIANT
GUY THERE AND I GO LIKE, LET'SMOVE...
(LAUGHTER)
>> RIGHT, RIGHT RIGHT. YEAH.YEAH.
>> Jon: BUT EVEN WHEN THEY DIDTHAT, SO
ALL THE WASTE WENTINTO THE LAKE AND THAT WAS
APPARENTLY UPSTREAM AND SO THEYHAD TO REVERSE,
DIDN'T THEY HAVE TO REVERSE THERIVER?
>> YEAH. THAT WAS THE NEXT GREATENGINEERING PROJECT
THAT THEY DID.
>> Jon: AND THEY REVERSED THERIVER?
>> IT'S EXTRAORDINARY.AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS PART OF
THE POINT IS THAT WE HAVE, WEHAVE A WHOLE SET OF PROBLEMS NOW
THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE WITHCOMPARABLE INGENUITY,
BUT WE NEED TO BE KIND OFREMINDING OURSELVES OF THIS
HISTORY AND CELEBRATING THIS. IMEAN, PEOPLE WHO FIRST
CHLORINATED THE WATER.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> THERE WAS A GUY NAMED JOHNLEAL WHO INTRODUCED CHLORINE
INTO THE WATER IN NEW JERSEY,ACTUALLY,
AND EVERYBODYTHOUGHT HE WAS INSANE.
>> Jon: YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> RIGHT. I MEAN,CHLORINE IS POISON IF YOU DRINK
IT, YOU KNOW, KIND OF --
>> Jon: NOT INNEW JERSEY.
>> EXACTLY. IT'S REFRESHING! (LAUGHTER)
BUT HE ENDED UP CONVINCINGEVERYBODY THAT THIS WAS THE
WAY TO KILL BACTERIA IN THEWATER AND IT CUT INFANT
MORTALITY AND CHILD MORTALITYHALF IN 30 YEARS.
>> Jon: RIGHT. YEAH IT'SINCREDIBLE.
AND WHEN YOU THINGS SEEMDAUNTING AND YOU REALIZE THEY'VE
BEEN DIGESTED, YOU HAVE TO LOOKAT HOW FAR WE'VE COME AND
I THINK IT DOES GIVE YOUOPTIMISM.
>> YEAH.>> THAT INGENUITY HAS A THING
THERE. IT'S ANUNBELIEVABLE BOOK. AND IT'S
SOMETHING, LIKE WATCH THE SHOWTOO WITH YOUR KIDS.
BECAUSE IT'S A GREAT THING TO DOTOGETHER AND THE WAY THAT IT'S
LAID OUT IS REALLY FASCINATINGAND ITS A WONDERFUL THING
TO DO TOGETHER AND VERYENTERTAINING THING AS WELL.
