>> Stewart: HEY, WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, HE IS THE HEAD
OF THE U.N. REFUGEE AGENCY IN
JORDAN BASED AT THE CAMP ON THE
SYRIAN BORDER.
WELCOME TO THE SHOW ANDREW
HARPER!  HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING
IN TO JOIN US.
YOU DO GRIM YET INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT WORK.
TELL ME, YOU KNOW, WE CAN ARGUE
ALL DAY ABOUT THE POLITICS OF
ASSAD AND THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS
AND SHOULD WE INTERVENE, SHOULD
WE NOT, THERE IS NO ARGUMENT
ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN DISASTER
THAT HAS UNFOLDED IN THIS REGION
AND CAN YOU GIVE US A BRIEF
UPDATE ON THAT?
>> WELL, THANKS, JON, ALSO THANK
YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK BECAUSE
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POLITICS
AND SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THE
SECURITY, BUT WHAT IS
CONTINUALLY FORGOTTEN IN ALL OF
THE CONFLICTS IS WHAT IS
HAPPENING TO THE SYRIANS.
AND TODAY WE HAVE MARKED
2 MILLION REFUGEES HAVING FLED
ACROSS THE BORDER INTO JORDAN,
INTO TURKEY, INTO IRAQ, INTO
LEBANON.
AND THIS IS THE TRAGEDY.
ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE
5 MILLION, AND THESE ARE NUMBERS
WHICH NO ONE CAN REALLY
COMPREHEND BECAUSE EACH ONE OF
THESE REFUGEES, EACH ONE OF
THESE PERSONS BASICALLY FLED
THEIR HOMES AND NO ONE WANTS TO
FLEE THEIR HOMES BUT THEY HAVE
FLED BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN
BOMBED, THEY DON'T HAVE ACT
STOAS SERVICES, AND THEY HAVE
LEFT WITH ALMOST NOTHING, BUT
OFTEN THE CLOTHES THAT ARE ON
THEIR BACK, CHILDREN OFTEN HAVE
HAD TO FLEE THEIR HOMES WHICH
ARE BEING BOMBED.
>> Stewart: AND THE AMOUNT OF
CHILDREN AND THE AMOUNT OF WOMEN
IS ASTONISHING.
>> LAST WEEK OR TWO WEEKS AGO WE
HIT 1 MILLION CHILDREN HAVING
FLED ACROSS THE BORDER AND THESE
NUMBERS, ARE JUST NUMBERS WHEN
THEY ARE REPORTED IN THE PRESS,
BUT WHEN YOU ARE ACTUALLY
WORKING WITH REFUGEES OR WORKING
WITH THE DISPLACED THEN EACH ONE
OF THESE INDIVIDUALS NEEDS HELP.
EACH ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS
NEEDS PROTECTION AND THE FIRST
THING WE HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU,
AS YOU DID IN THE INTRODUCTION,
SAY THANK YOU TO THE COUNTRIES
OF THE MIDDLE EAST THAT HAVE,
THAT ARE OFTEN STRUGGLING TO
PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THEIR OWN
POPULATION AND COMMUNITIES BUT
HAVE A WONDERFUL TRADITION AND
CULTURE OF PROVIDING SUPPORT TO
THOSE IN THE CONFLICT.
JORDAN, FOR INSTANCE, POPULATION
OF 6 MILLION.
>> Stewart: INCREDIBLE.
>> HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
IRAQIS AND 500,000, 600,000
SYRIANS AND THEY ARE THE PEOPLE
THAT OPENED THEIR DOORS, JORDAN
HAS NO OIL.
>> Stewart: OR WATER.
>> OR WATER, RIGHT.
AND BASICALLY HAD TO ABSORB WHAT
IS BASICALLY AN INTERNATIONAL
DISASTER.
>> Stewart: RIGHT.
>> IT IS NOT JUST A SYRIAN
DISASTER, IT IS NOT A REGIONAL
DISASTER, THIS IS AN
INTERNATIONAL DISASTER, AND IT
IS.
>> Stewart:.
>> AND THE PART OF THE U.N. YOU
SORT OF UNDERSTAND IS THE MORE
THEATRICAL, YOU KNOW, HUGO
CHAVEZ AT THE U.N. GIVING A
SPEECH ABOUT SULFUR OR WHATEVER
THAT IS OR, YOU KNOW, PUTTING
LIBYA ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS
COMMISSION OR THOSE TYPE OF
THINGS.  THERE IS THIS WHOLE
OTHER AVENUE OF THE U.N., BOOTS
ON THE GROUND PEOPLE LIKE
YOURSELF DOING THIS INCREDIBLE
DAY TO DAY WORK EFFECTIVELY,
EFFICIENTLY, IN A MANNER THAT IS
ASTONISHING TO SEE.
I MEAN I WANT TO SHOW, HERE IS A
PICTURE OF THE CAMP A YEAR AGO.
OKAY?  THIS IS DESERT IN
NORTHERN JORDAN.
A DESERT.
>> THERE IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT
GAVE TO START WITH.
AND THIS IS IT, THIS IS -- YOU
CAN SEE IT ON THE MONITORS.
THESE ARE THE FOLKS COMING OVER,
THESE ARE SOME REFUGEES LAST
WEEK INTO IRAQ, ABOUT 45,000
CROSSED INTO IRAQ LAST WEEK.
THIS IS ONE WEEK.
>> YEAH.
>> Stewart: SO THIS IS THE
CAMP MORE RECENTLY, NOW.
>> YES.
>> Stewart: THIS IS IN THE
DESERT AREA.
IT IS MUCH LARGER THAN THAT.
IT IS 120,000 PEOPLE THAT LIVE
IN THERE AND HERE,.
>> TOWS GIVE YOU A SENSE, THOUGH
OF SOME OPTIMISM WITHIN THIS, I
WANT WITH TO SHOW YOU THIS
PICTURE OF WHAT THEY CALL THE
CHAMPS.
>> GUYS COOKING CHICKENS ON THE
LEFT AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT THAT
HAS CREATED SORT OF SOME
SEMBLANCE OF NORMALCY AND
COMMERCE WITHIN THIS REALLY
DIFFICULT CONDITION.
>> WELL, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS
ALMOST LIKE WHEN YOU, YOU HAVE
2 MILLION PEOPLE MOVE ACT CROSS
THE BORDER IT BASICALLY EQUATES
TO WHOLE POPULATIONS LEAVING.
>> Stewart: RIGHT.
>> TOWNS, VILLAGES, WE PROBABLY
HAVE HALF OF THE PROVINCE OF
DARA WHO NOW MOVED INTO JORDAN.
>> Stewart: YES, JORDAN HAD,
IN TERMS OF DARA, THE DARA
VALLEY AND THE AREA OF NORTHERN
JORDAN HAS BASICALLY THE SAME
SORT OF FAMILIES.
>> YES.
>> Stewart: LIKE EAST AND WEST
GERMANY SO THEY HAVE ABSORBED
350,000 PEOPLE JUST IN THE HOMES
THIS CAMP IS JUST FOR THE
POOREST OF THE POOR WHO DIDN'T
HAVE THOSE HOSPITALITIES.
>> WELL, JORDAN TRIED TO AVOID
HAVING CAMPS AND TO ITS CREDIT,
LIKE IT NEVER WANTED TO PUT
PEOPLE IN CAMPS.
NO ONE WANTS TO BE IN A REFUGEE
CAMP, NONE OF US WOULD WANT TO
BE IN A REFUGEE CAMP SO FOR THE
FIRST TWO, 300,000 PEOPLE, IT
ALLOWED PEOPLE TO COME IN AND
ABSORBED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY
BUT THE COMMUNITIES COULD NO
LONGER ABSORB THEM BECAUSE YOU
HAVE CITIES SUCH AS URBAN NORTH
OF JORDAN, 200,000 MORE REFUGEES
ARRIVED THERE.
>> Stewart: AND THESE ARE
WORKERS AND THEY WANT TO --
PEOPLE WILL HIRE THEM FOR LOWER
AND PUTS PRESSURE ON THE
ECONOMY.
LET ME ASK YOU, WILL YOU STICK
AROUND AND TALK A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT IT?
>> SURE.
>> Stewart: I APPRECIATE THAT.
S THERE ANYTHING PEOPLE CAN DO?
CAN THEY DONATE?
>> FIRSTLY, I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO
SAY AS I AM IN THE STATES I
WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE U.S.
PEOPLE AS WELL BECAUSE THEY HAVE
BEEN THE BIGGEST AND MOST
GENEROUS DOE MORE TO THE
HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE AND THIS
IS SOMETHING WE HAVE UNDER THE
RADAR IT HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC
CONTRIBUTION SO FAR BUT WHAT WE
HAVE SEEN IS WE HAVE BEEN ALMOST
AN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF
REFUGEES CROSS THE BORDERS, WE
HAVEN'T BEEN OVERWHELMED WE WILL
NOT BE OVERWHELMED BUT WE NEED
THE MONEY TO CONTINUE TO WORK.
>> Stewart: YOU CAN DOE LATE
IN TO THE,, THIS REFUGEE EFFORT
IN JORDAN AND OTHER PLACES
AROUND THE WORLD,
UNREFUGEES.ORG.
>> ANDREW HARPER, WE WILL BE
