ABOUT?
(LAUGHTER)
CAN YOU GET DEPORTED FOR TELLING
A JOKE LIKE THAT?
SO DEMOCRATS ARE ON BOARD BUT
REPUBLICANS MAY TAKE A LITTLE
MORE CONVINCING, SURE.
DR. GRAHAM MAY HAVE A
PRESCRIPTION FOR ELECTORAL
SUCCESS BUT EVEN THOUGH THEY
KNOW THIS IS GOOD FOR THEM
THEY'RE GOING RESIST IT-- LIKE A
CHILD WITH VEGETABLES.
(LAUGHTER)
OR A FRAT BOY WITH A CONDOM.
EVEN THE PRO IMMIGRATION
REPUBLICANS' TONE CAN BE A
LITTLE CLUMSY.
>> IMMIGRANTS ARE MORE FERTILE
AND THEY LOVE FAMILIES AND THEY
HAVE MORE INTACT FAMILIES AND
THEY BRING A YOUNGER POPULATION.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
>> Jon: LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
TRYING TO HELP BUT I DON'T THINK
YOUR STRONGEST ARGUMENT IS THAT
BABY MACHINES WHO LOVE TO
(BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
AND HE'S SUPPORTIVE OF THEM.
EVEN LATINO REPUBLICANS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WRITING OF
THIS BILL ARE NOW TRYING TO
WATER IT DOWN.
>> I FILED AN AMENDMENT TO
IMPROVE IT EVEN FURTHER.
I'M SAYING WHEN YOU APPLY FOR
THAT GREEN CARD AFTER THE
TEN-YEAR PERIOD AND MORE HAS
EXPIRED YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
PROVE THAT YOU'RE PROFICIENT IN
ENGLISH.
>> John: OKAY, SO I THINK IT'S
ABOUT TO BECOME OFFICIAL.
THE RULES TO BECOME AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN
THE RULES TO BECOME MISS UTAH.
>> FRANKLY MEAN ARE -- SEEN AS
-- THE LEADERS OF THIS SO WE
NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO --
CREATE EDUCATION BETTER SO THAT
WE CAN -- SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
THANK YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: NO, NO.
THANK YOU.
WE THANK YOU, MISS UTAH, FOR
GIVING AMERICA A NEW RING TONE.
(LAUGHTER)
AND FOR OTHER REPUBLICANS,
PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH STILL
ISN'T EVEN FAR ENOUGH.
>> THE BILL DOES VERY LITTLE TO
ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO COME OUT
OF THE SHADOWS WHETHER CHERISH
OR USE THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
>> John: IT'S NOT YOU HAVE NO
"COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS" AND
SPEAK IT, YOU HAVE TO CHERISH
IT.
(LAUGHTER)
CHERISH IT LIKE A MAN WHO TWEETS
OUT SINGLE LETTERS OF THE
ALPHABET TO SO YOU CAN CHERISH
EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY BECAUSE
EVERY CHARACTER IS PRECIOUS.
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SOMEONE
ELSE HAS AN AMENDMENT TO
PROPOSE.
>> THAT AMENDMENT BY REPUBLICAN
JOHN CORNYN WOULD FORCE THE
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
TO REACH SPECIFIC METRICS SUCH
AS APPREHENSION OF AT LEAST 90%
OF ALL ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS
FOR THE OVERALL LAW TO STAND.
>> John: 90% BORDER SECURITY.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
BRING NINE FRIENDS WITH YOU AND
YOU GET IN FREE!
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)
YES, THAT'S THE AUTHOR YOU WILL
BE UP ONE NEW COUNTRY AND DOWN
NINE OLD FRIENDS.
AND IT ISN'T JUST THE CONTENT OF
THE BILL THAT REPUBLICANS HATE.
>> THIS IS NOT AN EASY BILL TO
READ.
>> SUBPARAGRAPH CAPITAL "C"
INDEX -- THE INDEX CALCULATED
UNDER THIS SUBPARAGRAPH FOR A
CURRENT YEAR EQUALS THE SUM OF
SUBPARAGRAPH ROMAN NUMERAL I.
>> I'M SURE YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT THAT MEANS.
>> Jon: WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT MEANS, BUT TO BE FAIR I'M NOT
A SENATOR.
YOU ARE.
AND LEGAL JARGON IS KIND OF THE
OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF THE SENATE.
SO IF I MAY FOLLOW A PAGE FROM
YOUR PARTY'S PLAY BOOK, LEARN TO
SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OR GO BACK TO
WHERE YOU CAME FROM.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TO TO SUM UP, STILL A LOT OF
CHALLENGES AHEAD FOR THIS
IMMIGRATION BILL TO ACHIEVE ITS
DREAM OF LEGAL STATUS WITHIN THE
UNITED STATES.
NOW CURRENTLY IT'S LIVING IN THE
LAND OF BILLS, BUT IT'S YEARNING
FOR A BETTER LIFE AS A LAW IT
PAYS ITS HARD EARNED POLITICAL
CAPITAL TO A GANG OF NOT
ENTIRELY RELIABLE TOYOTAS TO
CROSS THE LEGISLATIVE DESERT
ONLY TO GAV GAIT THE PERILOUS
WATERS OF DEBATE HOPING IT CAN
EVADE THE DREADED FILIBUSTER
PATROL.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT AFTER ALL THAT IT'S SAFE AND
THERE WILL BE NOTHING STOPPING
IMMIGRATION REFORM FROM STARTING
ITS BRAND NEW LIFE IN AMERICA.
>> I'VE GOT REAL CONCERNS ABOUT
THE SENATE BILL.
>> John: OH, YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
A THOUSAND FOOT HIGH BORDER
FENCE BUILT OUT OF IGNORANCE AND
SPITE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SORRY.
SORRY IMMIGRATION REFORM.
YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING MADE
INTO LAW SEEM TO BE NO BUENO.
WE'LL BE
