>> Jon:  WE HAVE A LONGSEGMENT AND IT'S UP ON THE WEB
BUT CONCLUDING ON THIS I WANT TOTALK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE LOST IN
TERMS OF SHARED PURPOSE AS ACOUNTRY AND SACRIFICE.
WE HAVE THESE ENDLESS WARS.
IT'S BEEN 15 YEARS WE'RE INIRAQ, AFGHANISTAN.
YEMEN.
MILITARY FAMILIES.
LESS THAN 1% OF AMERICANS AREBEARING THE ENTIRE BRUNT OF
THIS.
THERE IS NO REAL SENSE OF SHAREDSACRIFICE.
WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT REALLYCHANGES THE PARADIGM, COLLEGE
BEING THREE YEARS AND THEN ONEYEAR OF SELECTIVE SERVICE.
THAT SELECTIVE SERVICE BEING IN,IT COULD BE SOCIAL SERVICE, IT
COULD BE SOMETHING ELSE.
BUT BRINGING THE SENSE OFSACRIFICE BACK TO THE COUNTRY,
AND I WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE,EVEN OLD PEOPLE COULD DO IT, I
WOULD DO IT.
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE AWONDERFUL IDEA FOR US TO THINK
ABOUT HOW WE BUILD ON THENATIONAL SERVICE THAT CURRENT
EXISTS AND EXPAND IT.
NOW HOW PEOPLE RESPOND TO ITPOLITICALLY, HOW YOUNG PEOPLE
RESPOND, IT WOULD BEINTERESTING.
>> Jon:  I THINK YOUNG PEOPLEWOULD EMBRACE IT AND OTHERS
WOULD SEE IT AS -->> SEE, HERE'S WHAT I, YOU KNOW
THE BEST EDUCATION I GOT WAS AFEW YEARS ME WORKING IN LOW
INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AS ANORGANIZER NOT REALLY KNOWING
MUCH WHAT I WAS DOING.
BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT I WANTEDTO TRY TO COMMIT MYSELF TO
SOMETHING BIGGER THAN JUST ME.
AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE I MEETAROUND THE COUNTRY, AND BY THE
WAY AROUND THE WORLD, THEY HAVETHAT SAME SENSE.
THIS NOTION THAT YOUNG PEOPLEHAVE LOST THEIR IDEALISM OR
BEING CYNICAL OR IRONIC, IT'SNOT TRUE.
BUT WE HAVE TO GIVE THEMPATHWAYS TO GET THEM INVOLVED.
AND SO WE'VE TRIED TO EXPANDTHINGS LIKE AMERICOR AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE.
PART OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO ISHOPEFULLY TIE IT MORE TO GETTING
A LOWER COST COLLEGE EDUCATIONSO THEY GET SCHOLARSHIPS IN
RETURN FOR THE WORK THEY'REDOING.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOODPLACE FOR US TO START.
WE'RE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT THEMIDDLE EAST IN AN ISSUE LIKE
IRAN.
I REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO PAYATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE.
AND LEARN ABOUT IT, AND THENCONTACT YOUR ELECTED
REPRESENTATIVES AND EXPRESS YOUROPINIONS.
I MEAN MAYBE NOT EVERYBODY'SGOING TO AGREE WITH ME ON THIS,
BUT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHEREWE HAVE A HUGE ISSUE OF WAR AND
PEACE, EITHER THE STOPPINGNUCLEAR WEAPONS THROUGH
DIPLOMACY OR POTENTIALLY WE HAVEA MILITARY OPTION.
YOU'VE GOT A BUNCH OF HOT HEADSAND PUNDITS AND FOLKS WHO ARE
NOT GOING TO BE MAKINGSACRIFICES IF IN FACT YOU END UP
IN A CONFLICT.
WHO ARE REPRIZING SOME OF THESAME POSITIONS WE SAW DURING THE
IRAQ WAR, NOT ASKING TOUGHQUESTIONS.
AND IF THEY'RE NOT HEARING FROMCITIZENS, THEN WE END UP MAKING
BAD CHOICES.
AND THE ONE THING I KNOW SINCE,AS I ENTER INTO THE LAST YEAR OF
MY PRESIDENCY, IS THAT THECOUNTRY IS FULL OF GOOD AND
DECENT PEOPLE.
AND THERE IS A SENSE OF COMMONPURPOSE AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD
LEVEL.
AND IN THE SCHOOL AND THEWORKPLACE.
AND THAT DISSIPATES BECAUSE ALLTHE MONEY AND BECAUSE OF ALL THE
FILTERS AND ALL THE POLARIZINGTHAT TAKES PLACE IN TERMS OF HOW
OUR POLITICS TAKE SHAPE.
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT THATIS BY PEOPLE GETTING INVOLVED.
IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT MUCH.
I GUARANTEE YOU IF PEOPLE FEELSTRONGLY ABOUT MAKING SURE IRAN
DOESN'T GET A NUCLEAR WEAPONWITHOUT GOING TO WAR AND THAT IS
EXPRESSED TO CONGRESS, THENPEOPLE WILL BELIEVE IN THAT.
AND THE SAME IS TRUE ON EVERYSINGLE ISSUE.
IF PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED,EVENTUALLY THE POLITICAL SYSTEM
RESPONDS DESPITE THE MONEY,DESPITE THE LOBBYISTS, IT
STILL RESPONDS.
>> Jon:  SO FOR YOU AND THISMAY BE A CLOSING SEGMENT BECAUSE
OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE THINGS TO DO.
I'M HERE ALL NIGHT.
I GUESS WHAT YOU WOULD SAY ISAFTER SEVEN YEARS, IS THAT THE
ADVICE THAT YOU THEN BEQUEATH TOFUTURE PRESIDENT TRUMP?
[LAUGHTER][APPLAUSE]
WELL, I'M SURE THE REPUBLICANSARE ENJOYING MR. TRUMP'S
DOMINANCE -->> Jon:  ANYTHING THAT MAKES
THEM LOOK LESS CRAZY.
[APPLAUSE]THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STOPPING
BY.
IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO SEEYOU.
>> YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT GIFT TO THE COUNTRY
>> Jon:  PRESIDENT BARACKOBAMA.
