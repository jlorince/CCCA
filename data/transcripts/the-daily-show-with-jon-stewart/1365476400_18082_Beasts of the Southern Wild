WELCOME BACK.
EARLIER IN THIS PROGRAM, WE SAW HOW POLITICIANS CAN EVOLVE SEEMINGLY OVERNIGHT.
SADLY NOT ALL SPECIES CAN KEEP UP WITH OUR RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD.
JESSICA WILLIAMS HAS MORE.
>> Reporter: HABITAT DESTRUCTION.
IT'S PUSHED THOUSANDS OF EARTH'S PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION INCLUDING ONE OF
MOWER MOST BELOVED SPECIES
>> IN CHINA THEY WERE CUTTING THE BAMBOO FOREST.
THEY WERE CUTTING THE HABITAT OF THE PANDA.
THE PANDA WAS GOING TO BE EXTINCT.
THIS IS ALSO HAPPENING ON A DIFFERENT SCALE WITH THE PUBIC LICE
>> Reporter: THE WHAT?
PUBIC LICE Reporter: SADLY OUR CHANGING GROOMING HABITS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PUBIC LOUSE'S DECLINE.
>> PEOPLE ARE GETTING BIKINI WAXES AND ARE REMOVING GENITAL HAIR.
IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE DEFOR HE IS TAITION
>> Reporter: JUST AS THE EXPANSION OF LOGGING OPERATIONS HAVE KNOLLISHED MUCH OF THE
WORLD'S RAIN FOREST, WAX AND BURN TECHNIQUES HAVE THREATENED THE ECO-SYSTEM OF THE PUBIC LICE
UP TO 80%.
WHAT'S THE IDEAL HABITAT FOR PUBIC LICE TO THRIVE
>> SOME PLACE WARM, MOIST AND WITH SOME HAIR FLOATING AROUND
>> Reporter: IN ORDER TO SAVE IT, I SHOULD START ON MY OWN PUBIC HAIR
>> YES Reporter: I'M GOING TO START DOING THAT RIGHT NOW.
ONCE MY RESERVE BLOSSOMS INTO A LUSH SANCTUARY, I'LL BE ABLE TO BREED PUBIC LIFE IN CAPTIVITY TO
RELEASE INTO THE WILD.
WHERE DO I EVEN FIND SPECIMENS?
THIS DOCTOR BELIEVES THE SPECIES IS STILL FLOURISHING IN ONE OF AMERICA'S LAST PRISTINE
ECO-SYSTEMS, THE PUBIC LICE PARADISE KNOWN AS BALTIMORE
>> IN BALTIMORE WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH DECREASE.
WE GOT A LOT OF, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO, YOU KNOW,... JOHN WATERS TYPE
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN JOHN WATERS' TYPE?
>> YOU MAY HAVE SEEN TYPES OF FOLKS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN, YOU KNOW, IN SOME OF THE JOHN
WATERS' MOVIES.
YOU KNOW, WHO, YOU KNOW,...
>> Reporter: BUT EVEN CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED FILM MAKERS UNDERSTAND THAT THE PUBIC LOUSE IS BECOMING
A RELIC OF A BY-GONE AREA
>> 20, 30 YEARS EVERYBODY HAD CRABS.
I DON'T HEAR ABOUT ANYBODY GETTING CRABS TODAY.
IT'S OVER
>> Reporter: YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO COOL
>> EVEN ROMANTIC.
Reporter: ROMANTIC?
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU SHARED SOMETHING WITH YOUR PARTNER AND IT WASN'T FATAL.
>> Reporter: EVEN IF THE CRAB CAPITAL BALTIMORE DOESN'T HAVE PUBIC LICE, WHERE ON EARTH COULD
WE FIND THEM?
>> I WENT TO THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY TO CHECK THE COLLECT OF PUBIC LICE THEY HAVE.
THEY HAVE NOTHING.
>> Reporter: WHAT?
NOT A SINGLE SPECIMEN.
Reporter: IT WAS UP TO US SO I WENT TO THE LAST REFUGE WHERE SEXUALLY ACTIVE POORLY GROOMED
INDIVIDUALS ROAM FREE.
BROOKLYN.
EVERYWHERE WE LOOKED WE SAW A VAST ARRAY OF EDUCATION.
THE NATIVES OF WILLIAMS BURG, UNTOUCHED BY FIRST WORLD GROOMING HABITS APPEARED TO BE
RIPE ECO-SYSTEMS FOR PUBIC LICE TO THRIVE
>> CAN YOU HELP ME FIND SPECIMENS OF PUBIC LICE.
I'M NEW IN TOWN.
>> Reporter: SEE THAT RIGHT THERE?
THAT WAS WEIRD.
YOU HAVE TO EASE INTO IT.
EASE INTO IT.
>> THANK YOU.
HERE'S YOURS.
>> THANK YOU.
SO DO YOU HAVE PUBIC LICE?
Reporter: BUT DESPITE THE ECO-VALIANT EFFORTS THE FRAGILE PUBIC LOUSE HAVE ALL BUT
DISAPPEARED FROM THIS ONCE FERTILE REGION.
IF WE WERE GOING TO SAVE THE SPECIES WE NEED TO THINK LOCAL BUT ACT GLOBAL.
