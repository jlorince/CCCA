(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD PROGRAM FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, OH, WE HAVE
A GOOD ONE FOR YOU TONIGHT.
CELEBRITY CHEF ANNE BUEHRLE.
SHE'S GOT A GOOD ONE.
I'M BEING TOLD IT'S CALLED
COOK LIKE A ROCK STAR.
I REALLY SHOULD LOOK AT THESE
MORE CAREFULLY.
LET'S BEGIN TONIGHT WITH A
RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.
ON SATURDAY NIGHT IT BROUGHT
THE REPUBLICAN CONTENDERS TO
AN ABC DEBATE IN DES MOINES,
IOWA, IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE
THE SET OF A STAR TREK
CHRISTMAS SPECIAL FOR THE
BATTLE ROYALE BETWEEN GINGRICH
AND ROMNEY.
GINGRICH THE LATEST CANDIDATE
TO OCCUPY THE CENTER STAGE
SPOT ALONGSIDE ROMNEY
FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF
ONE MICHELE BACHMANN, ONE RICK
PERRY, AND ONE HERMAN CAIN.
VANQUISHED ALL OF THEM EARLY
ON.
GEORGE STEPHANAPOLOUS HANDED
MITT ROMNEY AN OPPORTUNITY TO
DO THE SAME WITH GINGRICH.
>> SPEAKER GINGRICH AND I HAVE
A LOT OF PLACES WHERE WE
DISAGREE.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE.
>> NAME THEM.
>> PLACES WHERE WE DISAGREE?
LET'S SEE.
>> Jon: UMM.
OKAY.
I WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THE
$1.6 MILLION THAT GINGRICH
TOOK FROM FREDDIE MAC WHILE
THE HOUSING BUBBLE WAS GOING
ON.
I NEVER HAD TO PAY $300,000 TO
SETTLE CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS.
I NEVER SHUT DOWN DOWN THE
GOVERNMENT BASED ON A SUB
OPTIMAL SEATING ASSIGNMENT.
I NEVER MENACED MANHATTAN
UNTIL I WAS DEFEATED BY THREE
COMIC GENIUSES AND ERNIE
HUDSON.
ROMNEY, YOU HAVE THIS ALL IN
THE BAG.
YOU ARE GOING TO CRUSH
GINGRICH.
GO.
>> PLACES WHERE WE DISAGREE.
LET'S SEE.
WE COULD START WITH HIS IDEA
TO HAVE A LUNAR COLONY THAT
WOULD MINE MINERALS FROM THE
MOON.
>> Jon: WHAT?
WHAT?
WE START WITH THE LUNAR MINE
IDEA.
ROMNEY, NEWT GINGRICH IS A
LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR BAD
IDEAS.
AND YOU MAGICALLY REACH IN AND
PICK OUT HIS ONE AWESOME IDEA.
PRESIDENT GINGRICH, THE ALIENS
ARE REBELING IN THE MOON MINE.
WHEN WE SHUT DOWN SECTOR 4.
A SWING AND A MISS, ROMNEY.
NEWT.
>> LET'S BE CANDID.
THE ONLY REASON YOU DIDN'T
BECOME A CAREER POLITICIAN IS
YOU LOST TO TEDDY KENNEDY IN
1994.
>> NOW, WAIT A SECOND.
>> Jon: DOWN GOES ROMNEY.
HOLY (BEEP).
THAT'S HOW YOU PLAY IT.
SO, I UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T
LIKE MY MOON MINES IDEA.
PERHAPS I COULD INTEREST YOU
IN A FRESHLY MINTED (BEEP)
YOURSELF.
OF COURSE, WHILE GINGRICH AND
ROMNEY ARE BATTLING IT OUT,
RON PAUL WAS KILLING IT.
KNOCKING 'EM DOWN ONE BY ONE.
>> WE WOULDN'T HAVE A FEDERAL
RESERVE SYSTEM AND WE WOULDN'T
BE INVADING THE PRIVACY OF
EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL IN
THIS COUNTRY WITH BILLS LIKE
THE PATRIOT ACT.
WE'D HAVE A FREE SOCIETY AND A
PROSPEROUS SOCIETY.
>> Jon: MINES ON EVERY PLANET.
HOW WELL DID RON PAUL DO?
THE MEDIA THAT NORMALLY ACTS
LIKE RON PAUL IS WEARING THE
CLOAK OF INVISIBILITY ACTUALLY
INVITED HIM ON TO ONE OF THEM
SUNDAY TALK SHOWS.
FINALLY.
RESPECT.
>> DID NEWT GINGRICH DO
ANYTHING TO DIMINISH HIS
CHANCES IN IOWA LAST NIGHT?
>> ARE YOU MORE COMFORTABLE
WITH ROMNEY AS THE STANDARD
BEARER OF THE PARTY.
>> DO YOU CONSIDER BOTH
GINGRICH AND ROMNEY
UNACCEPTABLE AS CONSISTENT
CONSERVATIVES?
>> WILL YOU ENDORSE....
>> Jon: HEY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO
GO OUT SATURDAY NIGHT?
I KNOW THIS QUIET LITTLE PLACE
WHERE WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHICH
ONE OF YOUR
