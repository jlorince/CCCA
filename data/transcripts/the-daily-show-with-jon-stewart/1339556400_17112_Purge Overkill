>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW"!
WOW!
THANK YOU!
I'M AN IT IDEA.
I WAS LOOKING THE WRONG WAY!
I WAS LIKE, OH... AH!
OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS COLIN POWELL.
WAS EVERY GUEST THIS WEEK, I'LL BE HANDING HIM A CUP OF SODA AND A CUP OF WEED.
(LAUGHTER) AND THEN JUST DOING THIS FOR SIX MINUTES.
(LAUGHTER) HERE AT "THE DAILY SHOW" WE POKE A DECENT AMOUNT OF5|AF FUN AT MEDIA
FIGURES, POLITICIANS, PERHAPS AT TIMES UNFAIRLY SO.
EVERY NOW AND AGAIN A POLITICIAN COMES ALONG WHO IS JUST TRULY TERRIBLE.
(LAUGHTER) AND REALLY DESERVING OF MORE SCORN THAN EVEN WE CAN DOLE OUT IN OUR NIGHTLY 21:30 WISE ASS-A-THON.
(LAUGHTER) I GIVE YOU FLORIDA GOVERNOR AND MR. CLEAN IMPERSONATOR-- IF MR. CLEAN HAD...
(LAUGHTER) IF MR. CLEAN HAD FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON RESTRICTED HIS CALORIC INTAKE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.
(LAUGHTER) RICK SCOTT.
YOU MAY REMEMBER GOVERNOR SCOTT FROM HIS LAW REQUIRING ALL FLORIDA WELFARE RECIPIENTS TO BE
TESTED WHILE REFUSING TO SUBMIT TO ONE HIMSELF.
>> GOVERNOR, YOU BENEFIT FROM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS EVERY YEAR SO
WOULD YOU BE-)m WILLING TO PEE INTO THIS CUP TO PROVE TO FLORIDA TAXPAYERS THAT YOU'RE NOT ON DRUGS?
NOT USING THAT MONEY FOR DRUGS?
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE GOVERNOR'S REFUSAL MEANT THAT AASIF MANDVI HAD TO MAKE AASIF MANDVI GOVERNOR
SMOOTHIES WITHOUT ITS SECRET INGREDIENT.
(THEb GOVERNOR'S URINE) (LAUGHTER) ANYWAY, GOVERNOR SCOTT'S
COST-CUTTING WELFARE PROGRAM-- WHILE DEHUMANIZING TO THOSE NEEDING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE-- DID
SAVE THE STATE OF FLORIDA...
NEGATIVE $45,000.
(LAUGHTER) WELL, NOW THE GOVERNOR AND FORMER LEAD SINGER OF MIDNIGHT
OIL HAS TURNED HIS ATTENTION...
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ... TO AN EVEN MORE PRESSING ISSUE: FLORIDA'S VAST STORES OF
REGISTERED YET INELIGIBLE VOTERS.
>> REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT SAYS FLORIDA'S VOTER PURGE IF YOU WILL, IS AIMED AT
CLEARING REGISTRATION RULES OF NON-CITIZENS.
>> Jon: WOW.
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN FEAR OF DEPORTATION YET INSIST ON VOTING.
(LAUGHTER) THERE MUST BE TENS OF THOSE.
(LAUGHTER) BUT HEY WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET THOSE PEOPLE OFF YOUR VOTER
ROLES, I'M SURE THERE'S NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
>> THE MIAMI "HERALD" HAVE FOUND "HISPANIC, DEMOCRATIC AND
INDEPENDENT-MINDED VOTERS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE TARGETED BY THE STATE'S PURGE."
>> Jon: SO, NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
(LAUGHTER) VOTEER PURGE DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETS HISPANICS.
RIGHT ABOUT NOW BLACK PEOPLE IN FLORIDA HAVE TO BE FEELING PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES.
(LAUGHTER) NOTHING BEING DONE TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM THE POLLS.
>> IN FLORIDA, THE EARLY VOTING PERIOD HAS BEEN CUT FROM 14 DAYS
DOWN TO EIGHT AND ELIMINATES THE SUNDAY BEFORE ELECTION DAY.
>> AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE TWICE AS LIKELY AS WHITES TO VOTE EARLY.
IN FACT, THE SUNDAY BEFORE ELECTION DAY THERE ARE DRIVES BY THE CHURCHES TO GET OUT THE:mz VOTE
BECAUSE THE POLLS ARE OPEN THE SUNDAY BEFORE THE ELECTION.
>> Jon: WHY CAN'T THEY JUST GO TO CHURCH ON SATURDAY LIKE THE REST OF FLORIDA?
