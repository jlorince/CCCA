SPREADING THE GOOD WORD ABOUT ONE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IS AN IMPORTANT
PART OF MANY PEOPLE'S FAITH.
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TOO HARD?
JASON JONES FILED THIS REPORT.
>> PASTOR JOHN RANKIN OF PARKSVILLE, TENNESSEE,
HAS BEEN PREACHING THE GOSPEL FOR ALL 18 YEARS.
BUT LATELY HE IS UP AGAINST MORE THAN JUST THE DEVIL.
>> THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FACING THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH IS THE DWINDLING OF OUR NUMBERS.
>> I DON'T KNOW MANY GUYS WHO WANT TO SIT IN CHURCH AND GET LECTURED AT.
>> HOW DO YOU ATTRACT FOAM YOUR CHURCH?
>> WE TEACH MIXED MARTIAL ARTS IN THE NAME OF JESUS.
CAGE FIGHTING.
ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP.
>> YOU TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO --
>> CHOKE, ARM BARS, LEG LOCK WE TEACH IT ALL IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
>> IT'S EXTREME MINISTRY'S CHURCH.
THEY PREACH THINGS LIKE LOVE THY NEIGHBOR, TURN THE OTHER CHEEK AND THERE'S A TIME TO
EMBRACE AND A TIME TO BEG FOR MERCY AND TAP OUT.
>> JESUS WAS THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HE HAD TO ENDURE FOR OUR SAKE, HE WAS THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER.
>> WHAT WEIGHT CLASS WAS HE AGAIN?
>> 150-175 POUNDS.
>> DOES TAPPING OUT MAKE JESUS CRY?
>> I THINK IN SOME CERTAINS IT ABSOLUTELY DOES.
>> SOME FAIL TO SEE THE CHRISTIAN VALUES ON DISPLAY HERE.
PEOPLE LIKE DALLAS EVANGELIST TODD KEEN.
>> THE HEAD SPLITTING AND THE TEETH FLYING OUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A
PLACE FOR VIOLENCE IN CHRISTIANANITY.
>> HOW DO GET YOUR MASSACHUSETTSAGE ACROSS.
>> WE SPLIT AND BREAK INANIMATE OBJECTS IN THE NAME OF JESUS.
WE BREAK CONCRETE WITH OUR HEAD.
WE RUN THROUGH ICE.
>> THEY INCORPORATE STRENGTH INTO THE CHURCH SERVICES AND EXPLAIN THE WISDOM IN THE GOOD BOOK
BY RIPPING UP A LARGER BOOK.
>> WE WILL SAY LITTLE NUGGETS LIKE LET THE WALLS REPRESENT WHATEVER IS HOLDING YOU BACK IN
YOUR LIFE AND THEN WE SMASH THEM!
>> AH!
>> ONE QUESTION:  WOULD JESUS THE CARPENTER ABOVE OF YOU -- APPROVE OF YOU MAKING GOOD
BUILDING MATERIAL?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
HE SEES SOMETHING COMING TO CHRIST ABSOLUTELY.
>> THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR RANKIN.
>> THE CHRISTIAN POWER TEAM, ARE YOU HEARD OF THESE GUYS?
>> YES.
>> THEY SAY THERE'S NO PLACE FOR VIOLENCE IN CHRISTIANATE.
>> I AGREE.
>> THERE'S NO PLACE FOR VIOLENCE IN CHRISTIANITY.
>> PUNCHING, KICKING,
BREAKING NECKS.
>> NOT VIOLENT.
>> LET'S LOOK AT THE DICTIONARY.
LET'S SEE WHAT THE WORD VIOLENCE MEANS.
>> OKAY.
VIOLENCE:  AN ACT OF AGGRESSION.
>> NOW WHERE DOES THE WORD VIOLENCE COME FROM?
>> MEANS TO VIOLATE.
GO LOOK AT VIOLATE.
>> VIEO LATE, A COLOR EUPBD IMMEDIATE -- INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN RED AND BLUE.
>> VIOLATE MEANS TO GO AGAINST SOMEBODY'S RIGHTS, TO ABUSE.
>> HE WAS RIGHT.
NO ONE WAS BEING VIOLATED IN THIS CHURCH,
ESPECIALLY NOT THIS KID LED TO RIGHTEOUSNESS,
VIA THE SLEEPER HOLD.
>> HE WILL BE UNCONSCIOUS FOR A LITTLE BIT.
THAT'S HIS BODY BRINGING BLOOD BACK TO HIS HEAD.
>> WHAT DID JESUS SAY TO YOU?
>> IF I COULD REMEMBER,
I'D TELL YOU.
>> WHO WAS BETTER AT SAVING SOULS?
THESE CHRISTIAN WARRIORS HAVE BEEN PERFORMING TOGETHER FOR 30 YEARS.
>> WOO!
>> THE MINISTRY HAS BEEN USED TO KEEP MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SAFE.
>> WHILE EXTREME MINISTRIES IS WORKING OUT SOME OF THE KINKS.
I WAS POSITIVE THE CHURCH WAS ANTIGAY.
>> ANTIGAY?
, YES, I THINK THE BIBLE IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT IT DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
DOES THIS -- THIS LOOKS A LITTLE GAY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> MAYBE TO THE UNEDUCATED YOU COULD SAY THAT.
>> SURE.
CLEARLY RANKIN'S CHURCH HAD A WAY TO GO.
FORTUNATELY THE POWER TEAM HAS JUST WHAT IT NEEDS, A BED OF NAILS, A 300 POUND BODY BUILDER
AND A 400 POUND LOG.
AND JUST LIKE THAT I WAS SAVED.
YEAH YEAH!
