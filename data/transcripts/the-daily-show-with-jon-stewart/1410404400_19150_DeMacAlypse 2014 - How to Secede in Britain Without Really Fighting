(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
OH, IF TODAY IS -- WHAT DAY ISTODAY, WEDNESDAY? -- IF TODAY'S
WEDNESDAY, IT'S TIME TO CHECK INON THE UNITED KINGDOM.
REALLY HASN'T BEEN A KINGDOMFOR QUITE SOME TIME.
AND NOW TURNS OUT THE UNITEDPART IS LOOKING A BIT SHAKY
AS WELL.
>> IN JUST OVER A WEEKSCOTLAND WILL VOTE ON
WHETHER TO BREAK AWAY FROMTHE UNITED KINGDOM.
POLLS SHOW RIVAL CAMPAIGNSFOR AND AGAINST INDEPENDENCE
RUNNING NECK-IN-NECK.
>> Jon: NECK-IN-NECK, BY THEWAY THE FIRST TWO INGREDIENTS
IN HAGIS.
SCOTLAND-- REALLY, THE RAYRICE TAPE, THEY CAN WATCH,
THAT PICTURE-- OOH SAUSAGE.
SCOTLAND'S BIG SECESSIONVOTE IS THE SUBJECT OF OUR
CONTINUING COVERAGE OF--DEMACALYPSE 2014.
IT IS NOT THE BRITISH EMPIRE'S
PROUDEST MOMENT, WHO ONCEDOMINATED HALF THE GLOBE.
BUT IF YOU LOSE SCOTLANDYOU'RE DOWN TO THE ONE
CORNER OF IRELAND THATDOESN'T HATE YOU, AND WALES.
TERRITORY WITH SO FEWNATURAL RESOURCES IT NEEDS
TO IMPORT VOWELS.
OF COURSE THERE'S GOT TO BEMORE-- IT'S HARD TO VISIT THERE.
IT'S HARD TO GET AROUND.
(APPLAUSE)THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE AT
STAKE HERE THAN PRIDE, YES.
>> THERE IS A LOT OF MONEYAT STAKE.
MOST OF THE U.K.'S OILRESERVES ARE OFF SCOTLAND
SHORES.
SCOTLAND IS THE EUROPEANUNION'S LARGEST OIL PRODUCER.
AND THE BRITISH NUCLEARSUBMARINE FLEET IS
HEADQUARTERED IN SCOTLAND.
>> Jon: OIL RICH WITHNUKES -- I BET DICK CHENEY JUST
WENT WHAT? WHERE?

U.K.-- .
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, I'M JUSTGOING TO --
(LAUGHTER)THAT POOR SWEET MAN.
HOW WAS HE TO KNOW LITERALLYEIGHT YEARS AFTER HE WAS
BORN HIS PROUD NAME WOULD BESTOLEN BY AN AMERICAN
HAMBURGER CLOWN.
IT'S PERHAPS A PROBLEM HE CANONLY DISCUSS WITH HIS GOOD
FRIENDS PAUL FRANKLIN CHANG.
AND THADDEUS GEORGE IRVINGFRIDAY.
BUT THIS WHOLE VOTING TOLEAVE THE UNITED KINGDOM,
WELL, IT BRINGS UP A VERYIMPORTANT QUESTION.
NAMELY, YOU CAN DO THAT?
BECAUSE WE KIND OF HAD TOFIGHT A WHOLE WAR WITH THE TEA
IN THE HARBOR AND THEBRITISH ARE COMING AND THE
TWO IF BY SEA.
MEANWHILE YOU JUST STICK ITON THE AGENDA AND YOU'RE
LIKE YEAH,  [BLEEP] IT,WE'RE GONE.
AND NOT JUST HERE IN THEU.S.
AFRICA HAD TO FIGHT YOU,INDIA STARVED THEMSELVES TO
GET FREE.
700 YEARS AFTER WHAT DO YOUCALL IT THERE, MEL GIBSON
WALLACE WAS DRAWN AND QUARTEREDFOR SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE, IT
TURNS OUT THEY JUST HAD TOHAVE AN ELECTION.
ENGLAND, ARE YOU JUST GOINGTO LET THEM GO?
>> BRITAIN'S POLITICALLEADERS LIKE DAVID CAMERON
HAVE HEADED NORTH.
TODAY THEY'VE ALL GONE UP TOSCOTLAND TO DELIVER A KIND
OF COLLECTIVE POLITICALLOVEBOMB.
>> Jon: OH, A LOVEBOMB.
THAT SOUNDS STICKY.
(LAUGHTER)I BELIEVE WE ACTUALLY HAVE
FOOTAGE OF PRIME MINISTERCAMERON PLEADING WITH THE
SCOTTISH PEOPLE TO COME BACK.
IS THERE ANYTHING MOREROMANTIC THAN THE SOUND OF
AIR SLOWLY GETTING PUSHEDFROM A BAG?
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
