>> THE STUDENTS WERE REQUIRED TOBE HERE.
IT IS A WEEKLY CONVOCATION THAT STUDENTS HAVE.
>> Jon: THEN CARRY ON.
OF COURSE NO CAMPAIGNLAUNCH WOULD BE COMPLETE
WITHOUT SOME WEIRDLY THIRDPERSON AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

BUT-- CRUZ, CRUZ LOOKED TOTHE FUTURE.
>> I WANT TO ASK EACH OF YOUTO IMAGINE, IMAGINE A
PRESIDENT WHO SAYS I WILLHONOR THE CONSTITUTION.
IMAGINE ABOLISHING THE IRS.
INSTEAD OF A GOVERNMENT,THAT SEIZES YOUR E-MAILS,
AND YOUR CELL PHONES,IMAGINE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
THAT PROTECTS THE PRIVACYRIGHTS OF EVERY AMERICAN.
>> Jon: WE GET IT, YOU ARE AFAN OF JOHN LENNON AND SMALL
GOVERNMENT.
YOU'RE A SMALL GOVERNMENTCONSERVATIVE FREEDOM GOOD,
BIG BROTHER BAD.
WHICH MAKES THE NEXT PART OFTHE SPEECH KIND OF
UNEXPECTED.
>> I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TOBREAK A RULE HERE TODAY.
>> Jon: I WANT YOU TO TURNTO THE PERSON TO YOUR RIGHT
AND SODOMIZE THEM.
>> AND TO TAKE OUT YOUR CELLPHONES.
>> Jon: OH, ALL RIGHT. TAKE OUTYOUR CELL PHONE.
NOT AS REBELIOUS AS ITHOUGHT BUT OKAY.
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOUBUT THOSE KIDS CELL PHONES
WERE ALREADY OUT.
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'REBORING.
LET'S JUST SAY YOU'RE MOREINTERESTING ON SNAPCHAT.
BUT THE POINT IS THIS-- YOUWERE SAYING IMAGINE, YOU KNOW,
THEY DON'T GET YOUR RECORDS,WHAT ARE THESE LIBERTY LOVERS
SUPPOSED TO DO.
>> TAKE OUT YOUR CELLPHONES.
TEXT THE WORD CONSTITUTIONTO THE NUMBER 33733.
ONCE AGAIN, TEXTCONSTITUTION TO 33733.
>> Jon: THE THING IS, HENEVER EXPLAINED WHAT 33733
IS.
HE JUST WANTED THEM TO TEXTIT.
SO LET ME CLARIFY THIS ALITTLE BIT.
STUDENTS AT LIBERTYUNIVERSITY WERE REQUIRED TO
ATTEND A PARTISAN POLITICALSPEECH WHERE A SMALL
GOVERNMENT CONSERVATIVE WHOHAD JUST PROMISED HE WOULD
RESPECT PRIVACY RIGHTS TOLDTHEM IF THEY CARED ABOUT
FREEDOM, TEXT YOURINFORMATION TO A MYSTERIOUS
ADDRESS THAT COLLECTS YOURCELL PHONE NUMBER FOR
UNDISCLOSED PURPOSES.
IMAGINE ALL THE PEOPLE,WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
