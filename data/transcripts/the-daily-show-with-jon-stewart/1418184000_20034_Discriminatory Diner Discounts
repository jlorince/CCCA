(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: WELCOME BACK!
NOW, AS THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVESHOWN, THE FIGHT FOR CIVIL
RIGHTS IS A LONG AND DIFFICULTJOURNEY.
HAPPILY, THE NEXT FIVE MINUTESWILL BE MUCH EASIER THAN THAT AS
JORDAN KLEPPER REPORTS.
>> THE AMERICAN SOUTH HAS COME ALONG WAY SINCE THE '60s BUT NOW
IN WINSTON-SALEM, ONE BUSINESSHAS FOUND A NEW MINORITY TO
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST.
ATHEISTS.
>> A RESTAURANT IN NORTHCAROLINA IS GIVING CUSTOMERS
A NICE DISCOUNT IF THEY DOONE THING: PRAY BEFORE YOU EAT.
>>THAT'S RIGHT. MARY'S GOURMETDINER WAS GIVING A 15% DISCOUNT
FOR BELIEVERS WHICH ACCORDING TOOUTSPOKEN ATHEIST DAN BARKER IS
A VIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS.
>> MARY'S GOURMET DINER IS VERYSIGNIFICANT.
UNDER THE LAW SELMA AND A 15%DISCOUNT ARE THE SAME THING.
>> SELMA, BIRMINGHAM,MARY'S GOURMET DINER?
>> YEAH, IN ONE CASE ITWAS RACE OR SKIN COLOR AND
ANOTHER CASE IT'S RELIGION.
>> EXACTLY. SO, I WENT TOSTARE STRAIGHT INTO THE FACE OF
HATE, ALSO KNOWN AS DINEROWNER MARY HAGLUND.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE SET OUTTO DO WAS TO MAKE EVERYONE FEEL
WELCOME. WE JUST FELT THAT ITWAS AN ACT OF REWARDING
PEOPLE FOR BEING GRATEFUL.
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF IT ASDISCRIMINATORY AT ALL.
>> HOW LONG HAVE YOUBEEN A BIGOT?
>> I'M NOT A BIGOT.
>>BUT YOU WOULDN'T SERVETHE PEOPLE FROM THE FREEDOM OF
RELIGION ORGANIZATION?
>> I'VE NEVER MET THEM.
>> CAUSE YOU WOULDN'T EVENTALK TO THEM WHEN THEY CAME
INTO THE DINER?
>> OH, I WOULD HAVE LOVED TOHAVE TALKED TO THEM.
BUT THEY NEVER SHOWED UP.
>> BULL (BLEEP). MARTIN LUTHERKING WENT TO SELMA AND
DAN BARKER DEFINITELY WENT TOMARY'S.
>> I DON'T THINK ANYONE FROMFREEDOM OF RELIGION WENT TO
MARY'S.
>> YOU DIDN'T GO DOWNTHERE?
ACTUALLY, IT CAME TO OURATTENTION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA.
>> ON THE INTERNET.>> ON THE INTERNET, YES.
>> YOU'RE TROLLING THE INTERNET.
>> SOME PEOPLE ARE TROLLING THEINTERNET, WE ARE NOT.
>> Jon: OKAY, BUT THERE WEREACTUAL ATHEISTS WHO ATE AT
MARY'S AND THEYWERE DEHUMANIZED.
>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEENDISCRIMINATED AGAINST.
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> I'VE GOTTEN THE DISCOUNT.
>> WHAT DID YOU DO TO DO THAT?YOU BROKE YOUR CORE BELIEFS
AND YOU BELIEVED IN GOD?
>> NO, I JUST SAID THANK YOU TOTHE CHEF.
>> I GET OTHER DISCOUNTS.
I GET ONE TO THE SYMPHONY FORBEING A SUBSCRIBER.
>> WHY ALL THEHULLABALOO?
>> I THINK THAT THEY'RE JUSTBEING DICKS.
>> YOU'RE NOT JUST BEING ADICK, ARE YOU?
>> THAT'S LIKE WHEN DID YOU STOPBEATING YOUR WIFE.
>> WHAT?
DID YOU -- DID YOU -- WHAT AREYOU TELLING ME RIGHT NOW?
>> YOUR QUESTION WAS YOU'RE NOTJUST BEING A DICK.
AND BY ANSWERING THAT I WOULDHAVE TO ASSUME I WAS AT LEAST
BEING A DICK, SO I CAN'TANSWER THAT QUESTION
UNTIL IT'S PROPERLY FORMULATED.
>> BUT ARE YOU BEING ADICK?
>> IF YOU WANT TO LABEL SOMEONEWHO FIGHTS FOR CIVIL RIGHTS IN
THE FIRST AMENDMENT, A DICK,YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO THAT.
BUT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GETTING THEDISCOUNT FOR PRAYING, THAT WAS
THE PROBLEM.
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE APRAYER, IT CAN JUST BE A MOMENT
OF QUIET INTERSPECTION.
>> Jon: LET ME GET THISSTRAIGHT.
>> IT'S A MOMENT. A BREATH.
>> IF I WANTED A DISCOUNT,I COULD DO THIS?
(DEEP BREATH)>> YES.
>> YOU'RE (BLEEP) ME.
>> NOT ANYBODY CAN GET IT. NO.
>> WATCH, THIS RIGHT HERE GETSYOU 15%.
THIS RIGHT HERE. THAT'S ME JUSTSTIFLING A FART.
>> WELL, WE DON'T DO IT.
WHAT ATHEIST WOULD PRAY TO ANON-ENTITY.
NO ONE DOES THAT?
>> ONE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO PRAYFULL PRICE FOR A B.L.T.
>> WELL, IF YOU WANT TO BE AHYPOCRITE ATHEIST FOR A
DISCOUNT, THAT'S FINE.
>> WELL, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IFYOU'RE A HYPOCRITE ATHEIST?
YOU'RE GOING GO TO NOT HELL?
>> I HAVE TOO MUCHINTEGRITY AS A RATIONAL PERSON
TO PRETEND THAT I'M TALKING TO AGHOST IN THE SKY.
>> YOU HAVE THAT MUCHINTEGRITY, BUT YOU WILL BITCH
ABOUT 25 CENTS EXTRAFOR EGGS?
>> YES, BECAUSE IT'S THEPRINCIPLE OF IT.
>> AND DAN STUCK TO HISPRINCIPLES BY HAVING ONE OF HIS
LAWYERS ACTUALLY SEND ATHREATENING LETTER
TO MARY'S GOURMETDINER TELLING HER SHE WAS IN
VIOLATION OF THE CIVIL RIGHTSACT.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
>> LOOK, I'M AN ATHEIST.
ALRIGHT, I GET IT.
WE NEED SOMEONE FIGHTING THEGOOD FIGHT.
IS THIS A GOOD FIGHT?
>> YOU CAN SAY THIS IS MOREUNFAIR OR LESS UNFAIR BUT IT'S
STILL UNFAIR. TAKE FOREXAMPLE GENOCIDE,
SUPPOSE YOU EXTERMINATED A WHOLEGROUP OF PEOPLE, 20,000.
THEY'RE ALL KILLED OUT. BUTSUPPOSE SOMEONE ELSE
EXTERMINATED 20 MILLION PEOPLE,ONE IS
SMALL BY COMPARISON BUT THE SAMECRIME.
>> WHY DID YOU BRING UPGENOCIDE?
>> IF I SAY THE WORD GENOCIDE,ARE YOU THINKING A NUMBER?
>> NO, I'M THINKING WEREN'T WETALKING ABOUT
MARY'S GOURMET DINER?
>> YEAH AND ON THE BIG PICTURE,GENOCIDE IS A BIG PICTURE.
MARY'S GOURMET DINER IS A SMALLPICTURE.
>> BUT THAT'S MY POINT.
>> EXACTLY, SO WOULD YOU THINK AGREATER GENOCIDE IS WORSE THAN A
SMALLER GENOCIDE?
>> NO, GENOCIDE IS GENOCIDE.
MARY'S GOURMET DINER IS BRUNCH.
>> WE'RE NOT COMPARING THEM.
>> YET THAT'S WHAT WE WERE JUSTDOING.
>> NO WE WEREN'T. WE WERE MAKINGAN ANALOGY.
>> WHICH AS WE ALL KNOW IS ACOMPARISON.
OKAY, I THINK I KNOW HOW TO FIXTHIS.
>> I THINK THESE GUYS ARE JUSTBEING PETTY ASSHOLES, RIGHT?
>> I REALLY DONT WANT TO SAYTHAT.
>> YEAH, YOU WON'T SAY ITBECAUSE YOU'RE A NICE PERSON.
BUT LET'S JUST TAKE A MOMENT OFSILENCE IF WE AGREE THAT THESE
GUYS ARE PETTY ASSHOLES.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> AMEN. IN THE END, MAYBE WEWOULD ALL BE BETTER OFF IF DAN
WOULD JUST LIGHTENTHE (BLEEP) UP.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULDAGREE WITH THAT. NO.
>> EVER HEAR ABOUT THEATHEIST, RABBI AND THE PRIEST
WALK INTO A BAR?>> WHICH ONE?
>> THE ONE WHERE THE RABBI ANDPRIEST SHUT THE DOOR BEFORE THE
ATHEIST CAN GET IN THE BARBECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO
HANG OUT WITH HIM BECAUSEHE'S SUCH A DICK.
>> THAT'S A JOKE?
>> NO, IT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
>> Jon: JORDAN KLEPPER, WE'LLBE RIGHT BACK.
