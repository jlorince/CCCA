I'M SORRY.
IT'S LIKE MAGIC.
THE ONGOING RACE FOR THE WHITE
HOUSE, AND ON THE REPUBLICAN
SIDE, THINGS ARE TRENDING IN ONE
DIRECTION, MY FRIENDS--
>> POLLS SHOW THAT MITT ROMNEY
IS LEADING THE G.O.P. FIELD FOR
2012.
>> HE'S AHEAD IN THE POLLS.
HE'S WAY AHEAD IN THE MONEY.
HE'S KNOT A MUCH STRONGER
ORGANIZATION.
HE'S GOT THE NAME RECOGNITION.
>> Jon: WOW.
MITT ROMNEY IS THE ONE THE
REPUBLICANS ARE TAKING TO THE
BIG DANCE.
ARE THERE ANY DRAWEXPWROOKZ WELL
IT'S HARD TO GET EXCITED ABOUT
MITT ROMNEY.
>> IF THE ELECTION WERE TOMORROW
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MITT
ROMNEY.
BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF THE
LACK OF CHOICE.
>> Jon: WOW.
( LAUGHTER )
THE REPUBLICANS ARE NERVOUS
ABOUT NOMINATING THE MORMON
EX-GOVERNOR WITH PERCEIVED
SOFTNESS ON SOCIAL ISSUES.
THEY'LL DO IT BUT WITH THE SAME
ENTHUSIASM AS, SAY, SOMEONE
TAKING THEIR COUSIN TO THE PROM.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.
YOU MIGHT STILL GET LAID, BUT
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL THAT
GREAT ABOUT IT.
WHAT?!
NO, I'M SORRY!
I'M SORRY!
( APPLAUSE )
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT!
I'M SORRY!
SO JUDGMENTAL.
ALL RIGHT, CLEARLY, REPUBLICANS
ARE LOOKING FOR AN OPTION.
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT?
>> JON HUNTSMAN MAKES HIS
ENTRANCE IN THE REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
>> IS HE LIKELY TO BECOME THE
SORT OF ANTI-ROMNEY CANDIDATE
FOR THE REPUBLICANS?
>> Jon: THE ANTI-ROMNEY.
HE'S A HANDSOME MORMON
EX-GOVERNOR WITH PERCEIVED
SOFTNESS ON SOCIAL ISSUES.
( LAUGHTER )
HE'S NOT THE ANTI-ROMNEY.
HE'S THE CANDIDATE FOR PEOPLE
WHO WOULD VOTE FOR ROMNEY BUT
ARE CONCERNED ROMNEY HAS TOO
MUCH NAME RECOGNITION.
( LAUGHTER )
COME ON, PEOPLE!
GIVE ME SOMEBODY TRULY
DIFFERENT.
>> I PERSONALLY THINK MICHELE
BACHMAN, YOUR COLLEAGUE, IS
GOING TO BE A REAL CHALLENGER TO
MITT ROMNEY.
>> Jon: THERE YOU GO, MICHELE
BACHMAN.
SHE COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT.
HE'S A MAN.
SHE'S A LADY.
HE'S TALL.
SHE'S SHORT.
HE LOOKS DIRECTLY INTO THE
CAMERA.
SHE LOOKS JUST TO THE RIGHT OF
IT.
( LAUGHTER )
HER CAMPAIGN GOT OFF TO A
RUNNING START WHEN SHE DECLARED
HER CANDIDACY IN HER BIRTH PLACE
OF WATERLOO, IOWA.
>> WHAT I WANT THEM TO KNOW IS
JUST LIKE JOHN WAYNE WAS FROM
WOORTLY, IOWA, THAT'S THE SPIRIT
I HAVE, TOO.
>> IT LOOKS LIKE SHE GOT HER
JOHN WAYNES CONFUSED.
JOHN WAYNE LIVED ABOUT 150 MILES
AWAY FROM WATERLOO.
JOHN WAYNE GACY, WHO RAPED AND
KILLED 33 MEN AND BOYS DID LIVE
IN WATERLOO BEFORE HIS KILLING
SPREE BEGAN.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon: HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE GOT
HER JOHN WAYNES CONFUSED?
MAYBE SHE WAS LIKE, YO!
I'M FROM WATERLOO, SERIAL KILLER
STRAIGHT UP.
( LAUGHTER )
JUST GOT IMPLANTS.
NICE GOING, MICHELE BACHMAN.
I'M SURE SHE ENDEARED HERSELF TO
HER HOME TOWN.
I BELIEVE THE WATERLOO CHAMBER
OF COMMERCE SENT HER A THANK YOU
CARD.
( LAUGHTER )
SHE MIXED UP SOME NAMES.
SHE'S NOT SCREWING UP THE
IMPORTANT STUFF LIKE THE ERA OF
HISTORY ON WHICH SHE BASES HER
ENTIRE PHILOSOPHY OF GOVERNMENT.
>> YOU SAID THE FOUNDING FATHERS
WHO WROTE THE CONSTITUTION AND
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
WORKED TIRELESSLY TO ENDS
SLAVELY.
WITH RESPECT, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
>> IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OF OUR
FOUNDING FATHERS, JOHN QUINCY
ADAMS, THAT WAS TRUE.
HE WAS A VERY YOUNG BOY WHEN
WITH HIS FATHER SERVING AS HIS
SECRETARY.
HE TIRELESSLY WORKED THROUGHOUT
HIS LIFE TO MAKE SURE WE DID, IN
FACT, ONE DAY, ERADICATE
SLAVERY.
>> HE WASN'T ONE OF THE FOUNDING
FATHERS.
>> JOHN QUINCY ADAMS MOST
CERTAINLY WAS A PART OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY WAR ERA.
HE WAS A YOUNG BOY BUT HE WAS
ACTIVELY INVOLVED.
>> Jon: RIGHT, BUT HE WASN'T A
FOUND FATHER.
HE WAS NINE AT THE TIME.
IF HE HAD SIGNED THE DECLARATION
OF INDEPENDENCE, THIS IS WHAT IT
WOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE.
HE WAS A KID.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL GIVE MICHELE BACHMAN
CREDIT.
SHE ACTUALLY MADE A NON-FOX
APPEARANCE UNLIKE OTHER
NONE-ROMNEY REPUBLICAN OPTIONS.
SPEAKING OF WHOM, WHY WAS PALIN
IN IOWA.
>> SARAH PALIN IS IN IOWA
TONIGHT TO ATTEND A MOVIE
PREMIERE.
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ANY MOVIE.
THE FILM IS CALLED "THE
UNDEFEATED" AND OFFERS A
POSITIVE PORTRAIT OF HER LIFE
AND CAREER.
>> Jon: ANOTHER TWO THINGS.
FIRST, THE DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE
LOSING VICE PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE IN THE 2008 ELECTION
IS CALLED "THE UNDEFEATED."
( LAUGHTER )
SECOND, YOU'RE CLEARLY RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT.
>> WHAT WE SAY ON THE FISHING
BOAT STAYS ON THE FISHING BOAT.
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ANNOUNCING
ANYTHING.
>> Jon: YES, WHY ANNOUNCE.
IT WOULD RUIN THIS SLIIOUS WILL
SHE OR WON'T SHE TENSION.
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT'S WHAT
KILLED "MOONLIGHTING."
GOVERNOR PALIN, I CERTAINLY HOPE
YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT,
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT, IF YOU'RE
JUST RIDING AROUND IN A GIANT
BUS WITH YOUR NAME ON IT TO
CATCH CAUCUS STATE PREMIERES OF
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT YOURSELF?
THAT'S FREAKY.
( LAUGHTER )
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE LIKE A
CHIMP IN A FERRIS WHEEL FROM
MICHAEL JACKSON TERRITORY?
I'M NOT APOLOGIZING!
NO, I'M NOT APOLOGIZING FOR
THAT!
I THINK IF SHE'S NOT RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT, IT'S A WEIRD THING TO
DO.
( LAUGHTER )
FINE.
( BLEEP ) IT!
I'M SORRY!
( LAUGHTER )
YOU KNOW, I THINK I MAY HAVE
ISOLATED THE REPUBLICANS'
PROBLEM.
IT'S NOT THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE
TOO FEW CANDIDATES.
IT'S THAT THE CANDIDATES THEY DO
HAVE ARE DOPER-GANGERS.
THEY HAVE THE HANDSOME MIDDLE
AGED MORMON TWINS.
THEY HAVE THE AMERICAN
HISTORY-CHALLENGED HOTNESS.
THEY HAVE CONSERVATIVE FIRE
BRANDS FROM GEORGIA, AND OF
COURSE A PAIR OF OAK TREES.
( LAUGHTER )
ONLY ONE OF
