>> Jon: WELCOME, WELCOME,
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT AUTHOR SALLY
JENKINS HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT
THE CIVIL WAR.
THE ONE THAT HAS ALREADY
HAPPENED NOT ONE OBVIOUSLY THAT
IS COMING.
THAT BOOK IS NOT OUT UNTIL 2012.
LET'S GET TO THE BIG STORY.
HEALTH CARE IS THE STORY ON THE
TIP OF EVERYONE'S TONGUE AND
THEY ARE NOT SURE IF THEY CAN
AFFORD TO GET THAT LOOKED AT.
BARACK OBAMA WOULD LIKE TO
REFORM HEALTH CARE BUT HE IS UP
AGAINST SOME OBSTACLES.
POWERFUL LOBBIES AGAINST REFORM.
A PLINT SPLINTERED DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
A COUNTRY WITH NO MONEY AND A
REPUBLICAN MACHINE WHOSE
REPRESENTATIVES WHO CREATE SARI
LOOKING DISINGENUOUS HEALTH CARE
REFORM OP ART THAT SOMEHOW FINDS
ITS WAY TO FOX NEWS THAT IS
TREATED AS GOSPEL.
>> A FLOW CHART.
I CALL IT CANDYLAND.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
THAT'S A LOT OF CIRCLES.
SEE IF WE CAN GET THROUGH THE
GUM DROP MOUNTAINS TO YOUR
DOCTOR GO.
>> OVER HERE.
NOW I'M LOST.
DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.
THE REPUBLICANS SAY WHAT IF YOU
STARTED WITH THE DOCTORS AND
WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CONSUMERS
YOU WOULD HAVE -- WOULD YOU HAVE
STRAIGHTFORWARD HEALTH CARE.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ALL OF THAT.
>> Jon: WOW.
THAT'S INCREDIBLY HONEST.
YOU COULD SPEND MONTHS MA
TICKOUSLY CONSTRUCTING A
MINIATURE CLIPPER SHIP OR DO THE
REPUBLICAN METHOD AND JUST ROLL
A DILDO IN GLITTER.
EITHER WAY YOU GOT YOURSELF A
CONVERSATION PIECE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
BY THE WAY, JUST TO POINT OUT,
ROLL A DILDO IN TKPWHREUTER IS A
COPY -- GLITTER IS A COPYWRITED
PHRASE FROM BRIAN WILLIAMS IN
NBC NIGHTLY NEWS.
WE'LL GET A CASE ON ANOTHER
NETWORK.
>> WE'RE JOINED BY BOB CASEY,
DEMOCRAT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
>> Jon: HERE WE GO A MEMBER OF
THE UPPER CHAMBER OF CONGRESS
AND THE BLITZ AND THE MAGIC
SCREEN.
LET'S DO THIS.
>> HERE ARE THE CONSUMERS OVER
HERE, ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS ME, I'M A CONSUMER.
OVER HERE IS THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.
HERE IS THE GOVERNMENT OVER HERE
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: SO MAGIC FINGER MAN IS
THE CONSUMER AND HE WILL BE
TRYING TO SUCKEL FROM THE GIANT
UNITEET OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.
SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH.
>> YOU ARE SAYING I CAN STILL DO
THIS WITH NO CONNECTION TO THIS.
>> YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH THE
SO-CALLED GATEWAY.
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> ONCE YOU GET INTO THE GATEWAY
THEN YOU HAVE OFPGS OPTIONS HNCH
>> THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT
OFFICE.
>> IT'S NOT AN OPTION.
>> IT'S NOT AN OFFICE.
>> IF I CALL THEM ON THE PHONE,
WHAT AM I CALLING?
>> Jon: NAILED IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TIME OUT.
TIME OUT.
(bleep) ALL THIS.
EVERYBODY CLEAR OUT.
LET'S GIVE THE BALL TO LEBRON
AND SEE WHAT HE CAN DO.
ON THREE, TEAM.
SO IT WAS THAT ONCE AGAIN LEBRON
HUSSEIN OBAMA HAD TO DRIVE THE
LANE HOPING FOR A MIRACLE FINISH
>> IF SOMEBODY TOLD YOU THAT
THERE'S A PLAN OUT THERE THAT IS
GUARANTEED TO DOUBLE YOUR HEALTH
CARE COSTS OVER THE NEXT TEN
YEARS.
GUARANTEED TO RESULT IN MORE
AMERICANS LOSING THEIR HEALTH
CARE AND THAT IS BY FAR THE
BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR
FEDERAL DEFICIT.
>> Jon: YOU ARE BLOWING IT!
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A TERRIBLE
PLAN.
>> WELL, THAT'S THE STATUS QUO.
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.
>> Jon: OH, A GET IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE OLD SWITCHEROO.
TEACH ME SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND
LET ME KNOW THAT WHAT I ALREADY
HAVE.
HOW WOULD YOU LADIES LIKE TO
MEET A FELLA THAT IS 50 POUNDS
OVERWEIGHT AND SMELLS LIKE URINE
NAL CAKE.
ROLL OVER, YOU MARRIED HIM.
I'M PRIMED FOR THE HEALTH CARE.
HIT ME WITH THE DETAILS OF THE
NEW PLAN THAT IS GOING TO SAVE
OUR COUNTRY AND MY LIFE.
IF THERE'S A BLUE PILL AND A RED
PILL AND THE BLUE PILL IS HALF
THE PRICE OF THE RED PILL AND
WORKS JUST AS WELL.
IF YOU FOUND OUT THAT YOUR
NEIGHBOR HAD GOTTEN THE SAME CAR
FOR $6,000 LESS, YOU WOULD WANT
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THAT
DEAL.
AND THAT'S WHAT REFORM SAUL
ABOUT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: ENOUGH ANALOGIES.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT MY
INSURANCE PREEM JUM LIKE.
WHAT IS MY DEDUCTIBLE?
IS GONE REA COVERED?
HOW ARE WE PAYING FOR THIS?
>> THE HOUSE SUGGESTED A
SURCHARGE ON WEALTHY AMERICANS.
TO ME THAT MEETS MY PRINCIPLE
THAT'S IT'S NOT P BEING
SHOULDERED BY FAMILIES WHO ARE
ALREADY HAVING A TOUGH TIME.
>> Jon: (bleep) THE RICH.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
TAX THOSE MOTHER -- SORRY.
HOLD ON.
I AM.
[ LAUGHTER ]
REALLY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SO IT'S COMING FROM ME.
OKAY P. IF I'M TAXED, WOULDN'T I
LOSE MY INCENTIVE TO EXCEL?
BOTTOM LINE AT THE VERY LEAST
OBAMA WENT TO TELEVISION.
HE DID HIS BEST TOLL CLARIFY A
PRESSING ISSUE.
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S IT FOLKS.
VAL LAYS FROM YOUR -- VALETS
HAVE YOUR CARS OUT FRONT.
IT'S OVER.
>> I TRIED TO MAKE IT SHORT AND
SWEET SO WE COULD GET THE LAST
QUESTION IN.
>> Jon: WHY NOT ROLL THE DICE
ONE MORE TIME.
>> RECENTLY PROFESSOR WAS
ARRESTED HAD THE HIS HOME IN
CAME CAMBRIDGE.
WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO YOU AND
ABOUT RACE RELATIONS IN AMERICA.
>> Jon: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
DOOOON'TANNNNAWWWEEERRR THAT!
>> NOW, I DON'T KNOW NOT HAVING
BEEN THERE AND NOT SEEING ALL
THE FACTS WHAT ROLE RACE PLAYED
IN THAT, BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR
TO SAY --
>> Jon: THAT'S IT'S A
COMPLICATED ISSUE AND I DON'T
HAVE ANY COMMENT AT THIS TIME
BECAUSE I WASN'T THERE AND I
DON'T HAVE THE FACTS.
>> THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE ACTED
STUPIDLY.
(bleep).
>> Jon: I COULDN'T SAVE HIM.
I COULDN'T SAVE HIM!
NOW, I WASN'T AT THE PRESS
CONFERENCE LAST NIGHT.
I ALSO DON'T HAVE ALL THE FACTS
BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY
OBAMA HANDLED THAT QUESTION D
OH, WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING
FOR?
STUPIDLY.
ALL RIGHT 56 MINUTES OF PRESS
CONFERENCE, 55 MINUTES AND 30
SECONDS ON HEALTH CARE, 30
SECONDS OF RACIAL CONTROVERSY, I
WONDER WHAT THE MEDIA WILL LEAD
WITH THE NEXT DAY.
LET'S GO TO THE WHEEL AND GIVE
IT A SPIN.
ROUND AND ROUND.
COME ON HEALTH CARE.
DADDY NEEDS A NEW HIP
REPLACEMENT.
(bleep) I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
ALWAYS BET ON BLACK.
>> WELCOME THIS THURSDAY MORNING

CONFERENCE LAST NIGHT MOSTLY
ABOUT HEALTH CARE BUT IT WAS THE
COMMENTS HE MADE ABOUT THE
ARREST OF AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
HARVARD PROFESSOR LAST WEEK
GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION.
THE TOPIC OF HEALTH CARE BUT IT
WAS THE QUESTION AT THE END OF
HOUR THAT HAS EVERYONE TALKING
THIS MORNING.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ASKED
ABOUT HENRY LEWIS GATES.
