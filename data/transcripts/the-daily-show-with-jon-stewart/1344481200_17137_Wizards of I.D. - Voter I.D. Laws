UNICORNS.
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ) IT'S VERY ODD, REPUBLICANS-- REPUBLICANS ARE THROWING MONEY
AT THIS PROBLEM THAT SEEMS TO HAVE VERY LITTLE FACTUAL EVIDENCE BEHIND IT, BECAUSE I
CAN THINK OF ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS PERHAPS A LARGER BODY OF SCIENTIFIC WORK BEHIND IT THAT
THEY ARE SOMEWHAT RELUCTANT TO TACKLE.
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING CLIMATE CHANGE ON THIS PLANET,
AND THE IDEA OF SPENDING TRLZ AND TRLZ OF DOLLARS TO TRY TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS IS NOT
RIGHT COURSE DISPL WE NEED A GLOBAL WARMING INVESTIGATION UNIT.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME SOMEBODY CHECKED ON GEORGE?
I SEEM TO RECALL AT THIS CONFERENCE I ATTENDED RECENTLY AT THE CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK FOUNDATION:
>> EVERY TIME YOU SEE A TRULY MASSIVE, COORDINATED EFFORT AT VOTER FRAUD, IT USUALLY INVOLVES
IN PART, ABSENTEE VOTING.
>> Jon:  THAT'S WEIRD.
WHY ARE THEY EMPHASIZING THE VOTER I.D. PART, THEN, AND NOT THE ABSENTEE BALLOT PART.
>> IT IS A FAIR AWMENT OF THIS LIBERALS THERE ARE SHOULD PEOPLE
WHO IGNORE THE ABSENTEE BALLOT PART BECAUSE SUPPOSEDLY REPUBLICANS LIKE ABSENTEE
BALLOTS MORE AND THEY DON'T WANT TO RESTRICT THAT.
>> Jon:  I GUESS IT WOULD BE A FAIR ARGUMENT OR AS IT IS SOMETIMES ALSO CALLED--
JUSTIFICATION FOR A LAWSUIT.
IF RESTRICTING ABSENTEE BALLOTS SEEMINGLY HELPS REPUBLICANS, WHO DOES REQUIRING PHOTO I.D.s TARGET?
>> IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT MORE HEAVILY THE GROUPS LIKE MINORITY, THE POOR, ELDERLY,
STUDENT.
>> Jon:  YES!
FINALLY THE FREE RIDE FOR THIS COUNTRY'S MINORITY POOR,
ELDERLY, AND STUDENT IS OVER.
( LAUGHTER ) NO MORE LIVING ON EASY STREET FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY LIVING ON SKID ROW.
THE ONLY THING MORE BLATANT WOULD BE IF YOU HAD SOME REPUBLICAN STATE REP IN
PENNSYLVANIA TOUTING HOW VOTER I.D. LAWS WOULD BE HANDING THE ELECTION TO REPUBLICANS.
>> VOTER I.D., WHICH IS GOING TO ALLOW GOVERNOR ROMNEY TO WIN THE
STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, DONE.
>> Jon:  NO ONE IS VIDEOTAPING THIS, RIGHT?
( LAUGHTER ) BECAUSE I'M GOING TO LOOK LIKE AN ASS ( BLEEP ).
WE GO TO JESSICA WILLIAMS IN PENNSYLVANIA.
JESSICA, NICE TO SEE YOU ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR THESE NEW REGULATIONS FOCUS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON MINORITIES AND THE POOR.
>> YES, JON, THAT'S RIGHT.
DEFINITELY.
>> Jon:  WHAT IF THROUGH A CONCERTED EFFORT THOSE GROUPS ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN THESE PHOTO
I.D.s NECESSARY?
>> NOT TO WORRY, JON.
THERE ARE SOME NEW REGULATIONS INTRODUCED THAT WILL FEATHER BATTLE THIS RAMPANT VOTER FRAUD.
IN YOU WOULD LIKE TO VOTE YOU WILL BE MATCHED AGAINST THIS,
OKAY?
( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE ).
>> Jon:  YUP.
>> YOU'LL HAVE TO FALL IN THE NONVOTER FRAUD COLOR RANGE,
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN VENETIAN DREAM AND TOASTED MERINGUE OVER HERE.
>> Jon:  OKAY.
HOW ARE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO KEEP UP WITHAL THESE DIFFERENT REGULATIONS THEN?
>> IT'S ALL IN THE NEW SWING STATES' HANDY VOTER'S GUIDE,
"YOU MIGHT BE AN ELIGIBLE VOTER IF..."
>> Jon:  LIKE THE OLD JEFF FOXWORTHY YOU MIGHT BE A REDNECK GAG.
>> ONE OF THE RULES IS YOU HAVE TO GET THAT REFERENCE TO BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE.
SO YOU'RE OFF TO A GOOD START,
JON.
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE-- IF YOU HAVE A FAVORITE MEG RYAN MOVIE, YOU MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE.
AND HERE'S ANOTHER ONE:  IF YOU'VE EVER SPOKEN TO A POLICE OFFICER VOLUNTARILY, YOU MIGHT
BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE!
>> Jon:  I GET IT.
LET ME TAKE A CRACK AT THIS.
IF YOU OWN MORE THAN THREE POLO SHIRTS, YOU MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE.
>> WHAT?
ARE YOU SAYING BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD POLO T-SHIRTS, JON?
THAT'S REALLY RACIST.
>> Jon:  NO I WAS JUST EYE THOUGHT-- I WAS JUST GO ALONG WITH THE GAMES, AND SAYING THE RULES.
>> NO, I'M JUST ( BLEEP ) WITH YOU, JON.
I'M ( BLEEP ) WITH YOU.
OWNING THREE OR MORE POLO SHIRTS IS RULE NUMBER NINE.
YOU CAN ALWAYS FOLLOW THE NEW GENERAL GUIDELINES AGAINST VOTER FRAUD IN THESE SWING STATES.
IF YOU'RE BLACK OR POOR OR ELDERLY AND NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR MITT ROMNEY, STAY THE
( BLEEP ) AT HOME.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  I GOT IT.
THANK YOU, JESS
