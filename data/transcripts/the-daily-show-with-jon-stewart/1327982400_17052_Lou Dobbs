>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE HOST
OF THE FOX BUSINESS CHANNEL'S
LOU DOBBS TONIGHT.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM, LOU DOBBS.
( APPLAUSE )
WHAT'S UP, MAN?
NICE TO SEE YOU.
HOW'S THINGS GOING
BUSINESSWISE?
>> GREAT.
GOING ABSOLUTELY GREAT AT FOX
BUSINESS.
>> Jon: BUT NOT THE ECONOMY.
>> WELL, I START THERE AND
THEN I WORK MY WAY OUT.
FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY I
THINK IT'S STARTING TO DO
BETTER.
>> Jon: IT IS.
>> I BELIEVE WE HAVE REACHED
THE TURNING POINT LAST OCTOBER.
I THINK WE'RE SEEING THINGS
IMPROVE SLOWLY, GRADUALLY NOT
AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE.
>> Jon: HOW WILL FOX BUSINESS
NEWS BLAME THAT ON OBAMA?
>> IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT.
THE FACT IS THAT PRESIDENT
OBAMA HAS ALL HIS CAUSAL
RELATIONSHIPS ALREADY
ESTABLISHED.
WE JUST REPORT THE FACTS.
>> Jon: WHEN DID THAT START?
>> ALL I CAN SPEAK FOR IS WHAT
I DO.
>> Jon: I UNDERSTAND.
IT'S EXCELLENT WORK.
HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING THE
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY?
IT SEEMS TO HAVE TAKEN A
TERRIBLY NASTY TURN OVER THESE
PAST COUPLE OF DEBATES.
>> HORRIBLE TURN.
NASTY.
WE LOVE IT.
>> Jon: THAT'S TERRIBLE.
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
A YEAR AGO YOU TELL ME ANYBODY
WHO WOULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT
THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY WOULD
BE INTERESTING, GALVANIZING,
COMPELLING, ENTERTAINING?
COME ON.
I MEAN THIS IS REALLY GOOD
STUFF.
>> Jon: BUT IN THE WAY THAT
FEAR FACTOR IS.
IT'S NOT... THERE'S NOBODY
EMERGING THAT... IT'S MORE
LIKE OH, MY GOD HE JUST ATE A
BULL TESTICLE.
>> I KNOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO IT
GO TO SOMETHING MORE PBS-LIKE
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
WHAT I LOVE AND I THINK MOST
AMERICANS REALLY DO AND I
THINK IN A CANDID MOMENT HERE.
>> Jon: YOU'RE ABOUT TO CALL
ME AN AMERICAN.
>> ABSOLUTELY I CALL YOU AN
AMERICAN.
>> Jon: THANK YOU.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> A GREAT AMERICAN.
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE THOSE WHO
DON'T ENJOY THE
ROUGH-AND-TUMBLE-- AND IT
ISN'T ALWAYS PRETTY AND
SOMETIMES IT IS NASTY-- BUT
OUR DEMOCRACY WORKS ON A
PUBLIC ARENA WHICH WE CAN TEST
IDEAS, PRINCIPLES AND VALUES.
AND WE COME TO A DECISION
EVERY FOUR YEARS FOR
PRESIDENT.
THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT
THINGS.
>> Jon: HERE'S WHAT I'M LIKING
ABOUT THE DEBATES.
THEY SEEM TO BE THE ONLY
MANNER IN WHICH WE CAN OFFSET
SOME OF THE BIG MONEY THAT
POURS INTO THESE CAMPAIGNS.
>> I AGREE WITH YOU.
>> Jon: THE DEBATES ARE
SOMEWHAT DEMOCRATIZING, YOU
KNOW, CLEARLY ROMNEY HAS AN
ENORMOUS EDGE IN SPENDING.
IN FLORIDA AND EVERYWHERE
ELSE.
WHETHER IT'S HIS MONEY OR
FRIENDS OF HIS MONEY THAT THEY
GOT.
OVER WHOM HE HAS NO CONTROL.
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: BUT THE DEBATES ARE IN
SOME WAY A DEMOCRATIZING
ELEMENT TO THAT MONEY, IT
WOULD SEEM.
>> I AGREE WITH YOU 100%.
AND THE FACT, YOU KNOW, THE
FACTS KIND OF MITIGATE THAT A
LITTLE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PRESIDENT
OBAMA, RON PAUL, RICK SANTORUM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> ROMNEY AND GINGRICH,
SOMETIMES IT ELUDES US THAT
THEY'RE ALL MILLIONAIRES SO IT
GETS TO BE A LITTLE....
>> Jon: IT WOULD BE
INTERESTING TO WATCH THE
MILLIONAIRES GOING AFTER THE
MULTI-MULTI-MILLIONAIRES.
>> IT'S A LITTLE... THE WAY
OBAMA GOES AFTER BILLIONAIRES
AND MILLIONAIRES NOT
UNDERSTANDING THE ORDER OF
MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A
MILLIONAIRE AND A BILLIONAIRE.
>> Jon: WHAT?
ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT THE
RHETORIC ABOUT CAPITALISM THAT
THEY USE VERY MUCH ON THE 99%
MOVEMENT, THE OCCUPY WALL
STREET MOVEMENT, WHEN THEY....
>> HAS THAT BECOME A MOVEMENT
NOW.
>> Jon: I THINK IT'S A
MOVEMENT.
>> BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO GET A VERY GOOD COUNT.
THE BEST I'VE SEEN IS REFS...
ESTIMATES IN THE 3,000 TO
4,000.
>> Jon: PROBABLY ABOUT 320
MILLION OF THEM.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IN THE 99%.
>> HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE IT
IS.
>> Jon: HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE
IT IS.
IT'S FUNNY.
WHEN YOU CRITICIZE
MULTIMILLIONAIRES-- AND I'M
ONE OF THEM.
GOD BLESS ME.
BUT WHEN YOU CRITICIZE THAT,
THEY SAY THAT THAT IS SOMEHOW
ANTI-CAPITALIST.
WHAT YOU'RE NOT CRITICIZING IS
CAPITALISM.
WHAT YOU'RE CRITICIZING IS THE
IDEA THAT THERE'S ALMOST LIKE
A WEALTH INCUMBENCY IN THIS
COUNTRY.
LET'S LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF
THE WAY THAT THE INCUMBENTS
GET TO WASHINGTON AND THEN
CHANGE THE RULES AROUND TO
MAKE IT THAT THEY GET TO STAY
IN WASHINGTON AS CONGRESS
PEOPLE AND AS SENATORS.
I THINK THE IDEA IN THE
COUNTRY IS VERY WEALTHY HAVE
GERRYMANDERED CERTAIN
DISTRICTS TO CREATE A WEALTH
INCUMBENCY.
IS THAT ATTACKING CAP
CAPITALISM OR IS THAT
ATTACKING A PERVERSION OF
CAPITALISM?
>> WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS
ATTACKING FEDERAL JUDGES IN
SAN ANTONIO TEXAS WHO WENT
ALONG WITH THE REDISTRICTING
PLAN FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF
TEXAS THAT THE U.S. SUPREME
COURT JUST TO OVERTURN BECAUSE
THEY WERE....
>> Jon: I USED THAT AS A
METAPHOR.
>> I WAS RESORTING TO FACTS.
>> Jon: THAT FEDERAL JUDGE
SHOULDN'T DRAW THE DISTRICT
HIMSELF.
THEY DID SAY WHAT THE
REPUBLICANS HAD DONE WAS
UNFAIR.
>> NO, NO, NO.
WHAT THEY SAID WAS THAT
FEDERAL JUDGES... (LAUGHING).
>> Jon: IN YOUR HEART YOU
BELIEVE THAT POLITICAL PARTIES
CHANGE DISTRICTS IN A FAIR AND
MEASURED WAY TO HELP DEMOCRACY
AND IN NO WAY DO IT TO GIVE
ONE SIDE AN ADVANTAGE?
>> NO.
NOT AT ALL.
WHAT I DO BELIEVE IS THAT
ELECTIONS, AS OUR PRESIDENT
CONTINUES TO REMINUS, HAS
CONSEQUENCES AND STATE
LEGISLATURES WHICH ARE
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT HAVE
THAT POWER AND ABILITY TO
REDISTRICT AND HAVE DONE.
>> Jon: DON'T WE HAVE A
RESPONSIBILITY WHEN WE SEE
THOSE CONSEQUENCES BEING USED
PERVERSELY TO SAY, HEY, MAN,
THAT SEEMS ILLEGAL?
>> I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE
SUPREME COURT JUST DID WITH
THOSE JUDGES WHO TRIED TO
APPORTION ALL OF THOSE
DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF
TEXAS NOT BEFORE....
>> Jon: ARE THEY LETTING THEM
KEEP THAT DISTRICTING MAP?
>> NO.
>> Jon: BECAUSE WHY?
WHY AREN'T THEY?
>> BECAUSE THE FEDERAL JUDGES
BECAME ACTIVISTS AND....
>> Jon: NO, WHY IS THE SUPREME
COURT LETTING THEM KEEP IT?
THE SUPREME COURT IS SAYING
YOU'RE RIGHT BUT THEY HAVE TO
REDO THE MAP NOT YOU.
>> NO, WHAT THEY SAID WAS YOU
CAN ONLY REDRAW FOUR OF THE
DISTRICTS AND YOU HAVE TO USE
THE LEGISLATURE'S WORK....
>> Jon: HOW CAN YOU CONDESCEND
TO ME THIS THEY SAID THE FOUR
DISTRICTS....
>> BECAUSE THEY SAID... THEY
REDISTRICTED ALL OF TEXAS.
>> Jon: I KNOW.
THEY REDISTRICTED ALL OF IT
AND SAID FOUR OF THEM ARE
CHEATING.
JUST FOUR.
IT'S JUST FOUR.
THAT'S LIKE SAYING I DON'T
MIND CAPITALISM BUT I DON'T
LIKE THE IDEA THAT YOU GET TO
TAKE CARRIED INTEREST AT
CAPITAL GAINS RATES INSTEAD OF
35%.
BUT MOST OF THE RULES OF
CAPITALISM IS FAIR.
YEAH, BUT THAT ONE IS NOT.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.
JON, FORGIVE ME FOR NOT BEING
CLEAR.
>> Jon: THIS IS NOT FAIR.
>> NO, IT IS NOT FAIR.
>> Jon: A JUDGE SHOULD STEP
IN.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
LET ME BE THE REFEREE.
>> Jon: HERE'S THE THING.
DON'T WE HAVE FUN TOGETHER?
>> WE DO ABSOLUTELY.
>> Jon: CAN I TELL YOU WHAT
WOULD BE A HILARIOUS MOVIE.
>> I'M READY.
>> Jon: YOU AND ME ROAD TRIP
TO MEXICO.
>> YOU'RE ON.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: LOU DOBBS, FOX
BUSINESS WEEK.
LOU DOBBS.
