>> A BUS.
IF THERE'S ANYBODY HERE WHO
NEEDS TO GET THERE.
>> Jon: THAT GUY.
WHERE ARE YOU COMING FROM?
>> MASSACHUSETTS.
>> Jon: FOR REAL?
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET TO
WASHINGTON FROM MANHATTAN.
>> COMING TO 560 BROADWAY IN
SOHO THE BUS WILL BE THERE,
WE'LL TAKE YOU WITH US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: IS THAT TRUE?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WHEN ARE YOU LEAVE SOMETHING IN
SATURDAY --
>> WE HAVE MANY BUSES -- WE HAVE
AS MANY BUSES AS THERE ARE
PEOPLE TO FILL THEM.
THAT'S OUR PROMISE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: LET ME SAY THIS:  SHE
WILL HAVE AS MANY BUSES AS IS
NECESSARY AND THEN ANYBODY ELSE,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
DO YOU KNOW -- YOU UNDERSTAND
THE WAY THAT THE WEB WORKS.
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE THAT
ARE COMING FROM DIFFERENT
LOCATIONS GET DOWN HERE BUT
WE'RE A LITTLE BIT CLUELESS IN
TERMS OF -- I'M FROM THE OLD
SCHOOL.
I'M -- I THOUGHT PEOPLE
CARPOOLED.
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND, HOW
WOULD THEY MEET UP.
IS THERE A LINK ON YOUR WEB
SITE, ON CRAIGSLIST.
>> YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YOU WORK ON THE MESSAGE.
I'LL WORK ON LOGISTICS.
>> Jon: WHY WOULD I GIVE A
MASSAGE?
YOU WILL BE ONE OF POINT PEOPLE
FOR LOGISTICS.
>> EXACTLY.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIRD WORLD
AMERICA.
I'M THEY'RE SETTLE BOOK!
>> Jon: YOU BROUGHT IT UP.
"THIRD WORLD AMERICA" THIS IS
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING.
THE HEART OF THE BOOK IS YOU
CAN'T DO ANYTHING UNLESS WE
REFORM THE WAY THAT WE PAY FOR
ELECTIONS.
>> RIGHT, BUT, BUT IF YOU GO TO
PAGE 199 IN SECTION 5 IT WILL
GIVE YOU SEVEN STEPS -- SEVEN
STEPS -- HE DIDN'T GET AS FAR AS
199.
IT WILL GIVE YOU SEVEN STEPS OF
WHAT YOU CAN DO BETWEEN MARCHS.
MARCHS ARE GREAT.
WE'RE GOING TO MARCH.
WE NEED SOMETHING DEEPER, MORE
SUSTAINED, LONGER.
>> Jon: I DON'T THINK YOU'VE
READ THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> COME ON, JON.
>> Jon: PAGE 199 IS ABOUT THE
PREAMBLE OF THE CONSTITUTION,
NO?
>> THAT'S WHERE IT STARTS.
IT SAYS LOOK AT THE LEADER IN
THE MIRROR.
THE LEADER IN THE MIRROR.
DON'T JUST WAIT FOR POLITICIANS
TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND SOLVE
THE PROBLEMS.
IT'S UP TO US IN BETWEEN MARCHS
TO TAKE STEPS LIKE "THE DAILY
SHOW", THE DAILY STEPS.
THE DAILY STEPS, YOU KNOW?
>> Jon: WHY ARE YOU MAKING MY
SHOW SEEM LIKE ALCOHOLICS
ANONYMOUS.
THE DAILY STEPS AND GOD GRANT ME
THE SERENITY.
HERE IS THE POINT:  WHAT CAN
PEOPLE DO IN MONEY IN POLITICS?
HOW DO WE REFORM THE ELECTORAL
SYSTEM IN TERMS OF WAY IT'S
FINANCES.
THEIR WHOLE LIVES ARE ABOUT
RAISING MONEY.
THEY ARE BEHOLDEN TO THE
INTERESTS.
HOW DO YOU GET AWAY FROM THAT?
>> I'M PROPOSING THE PUBLIC FNGS
OF CAMPAIGNS.
OTHERWISE THERE'S 26 LOBBIES FOR
EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL AND
OTHERS EVERY DAY.
WHILE WE'RE CAMPAIGNING FOR THAT
WE CAN TAKE STEPS TO REBUILD THE
COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW.
THERE ARE PEOPLE ALL OVER
AMERICA.
AS I WENT AROUND RESEARCHING THE
BOOK.
I'M STUNNED BY THE THINGS THAT
PEOPLE DO.
>> Jon: IN A GOOD WAY OR --?
AVERAGE I GOOD WAY.
LIKE UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE CREATING
A SITE LIKE WHO HAS TIME TO HELP
HELPING EACH OTHER.
>> Jon: IT'S AN AMAZING SITE.
PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED ARE
VOLUNTEERING FOR THINGS.
VERY EXCITING.
>> I HAVE EXAMPLES OF UNEMPLOYED
LAWYERS COMING TOGETHER HELPING
PEOPLE PREVENT FORECLOSURES.
WE CAN TAKE THIS LEGITIMATE
ANGER OF HOW WE'RE SCREWED UP BY
WALL STREET AND POLITICIANS AND
CHANNEL IT TO THE TEA PARTY AND
DEMONIZING EACH OTHER.
>> Jon: THAT'S NOT FIRE THEM.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WITHIN THAT
MOVEMENT -- BUT THEY ARE TRYING
TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS.
YOU MAY NOT AGREE.
>> WE CAN TAKE THAT ANGER AND
REBUILD THE COMMUNITY.
>> Jon: WE SHOULD INCLUDE TEA
PARTY WELCOME.
EVERYBODY WELCOME.
TEA, COFFEE ANY BEVERAGE, JUICE.
>> IF THE TEA PARTY PEOPLE WANT
TO COME ON THE BUS WITH US TO
WASHINGTON FOR THE RALLY.
>> Jon: THEY ARE TEA PARTY
PEOPLE WE'RE HUFF PO PEOPLE.
CAN'T WE ALL --
>> GET ALONG?
>> Jon: THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.
WE'RE NOT ENEMIES WE'RE WORKING
TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL, I WOULD
THINK, WE MAY COME AT IT FROM
DIFFERENT THINGS.
THE MORE WE GET ENTRENCHED IN
THE IDEOLOGY OF IT, THE LESS
WE'RE ABLE TO SOLVE THINGS, YES?
>> I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT.
REBUILDING THE COMMUNITIES AND
HELPING EACH OTHER IS BEYOND
IDEOLOGY AND LEFT AND RIGHT.
THE IMPORTANT THING FOR ALL THE
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU WE
HAVE TO KEEP IT UP BETWEEN
MARCHS AND ELECTIONS.
WE CAN'T JUST VOTE AND EXPECT
EVERYTHING TO CHANGE.
WHAT ARE WE DOING IN BETWEEN.
>> Jon: THE IDEA OF TWO
WORKING HOUSEHOLDS TRYING TO
RAISE CHILDREN, WHEN ARE THOSE
FOLKS GOING HAVE TIME THEN TO BE
ACTIVISTS OR TO WORK WITHIN THE
COMMUNITIES?
ISN'T JUST LEADING A STABLE
DECENT LIFE IN SOME WAYS A
POLITICAL STATEMENT?
>> IT IS NORMALLY BUT NOT NOW.
>> WE'RE AT THE TURNING POINT.
WE'RE IN DANGER OF BECOMING
THIRD WORLD AMERICA.
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY.
THIS SORT OF AMERICAN DREAM THAT
I BOUGHT INTO AS AN IMMIGRANT IS
NOT REAL ANYMORE FOR MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS.
AWKWARD MOBILITY HAS BECOME
DOWNWARD MOBILITY.
WE'RE TENTH IN UPWARD MOBILITY
BEHIND FRANCE AND GERMANY.
>> Jon: ONCE WE HIT ROCK
BOTTOM THINK OF THE POSSIBILITY.
ISN'T THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING?
IT'S A SIMPLE CORRECTION?
YONCH WANT TO HIT ROCK BOTTOM.
I WANT US TO CORRECT RIGHT NOW
STARTING ON OCTOBER 30 WITH THE
MARCH TO WASHINGTON.
>> Jon: WHAT?
>> AND GOING ON WITH THE SEVEN
STEPS TO RENEW AMERICA.
>> Jon: THAT WAS (bleep)
AMAZING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SAID.
WHATEVER THAT WAS.
"THIRD WORLD AMERICA" IS ON THE
BOOKSHELVES NOW.
