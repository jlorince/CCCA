>> Jon: HEY, WELCOME TO "THEDAILY SHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.
ADAM LEVINE OF MAROON 5, GONNABE RIGHT HERE. BUT FIRST,
THE 2014 MID-TERM ELECTIONS, OHTHEY'RE COMING UP FAST.
AND ALTHOUGH CONGRESS IS VIEWEDSLIGHTLY LESS FAVORABLY THAN
THAT MOMENT YOU SMELL VOMIT, YOUKNOW YOU'RE ABOUT TO
VOMIT BUT YOU HAVE NOTYET VOMITED.
ALMOST EVERY INCUMBENT IS STILLGONNA WIN THEIR RACE, ESPECIALLY
IN THE HOUSE, WHICH MEANS ALLEYES ARE IN THE SENATE.
WILL THE DEMOCRATS RETAINCONTROL?
[AUDIENCE MEMBER SCREAMS][LAUGHTER]
OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE IN THEAUDIENCE TONIGHT NOT FAMILIAR
WITH THE RHETORICAL QUESTION.THEY FEEL, PERHAPS SO
COMFORTABLE THEY FEEL THEY'RE ATHOME, THEY CAN JUST
YELL OUT, NOT REALIZING THISTIME I CAN HEAR THEM.
WILL THE DEMOCRATS WINCONTROL.
WE DON'T KNOW.
IT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'SDEMOCALYPSE 2014: IT'S ALL ABOUT
THAT BASE.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF REPUBLICANSRECAPTURE THE SENATE?
THE STAKES ARE STUNNING.
>> IF THE PRESIDENT LOSES THESENATE, HE WILL HAVE BOTH HOUSES
OF CONGRESS WORKING TO STOP HIM.
>> GRIDLOCK WILL BE EPIDEMIC.
>> Jon: OH, NO, GRID LOCK WILLBE EPIDEMIC IN WASHINGTON.
THAT'S LIKE SAYING THE INTERNETWILL BEEN INUNDATED WITH PORN.
NOW TRADITIONALLY THE MID-TERMSFUNCTION AS A REFERENDUM ONTHE
PRESIDENT. SO HOW IS THEPRESIDENT'S LACK OF POPULARITY
AFFECTING THE RACE?
>> THE ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIESARE SIMPLY WRONG.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S CLEAR,YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS
AFFECTS KENTUCKY.
>> I OPPOSE PRESIDENT OBAMA'SGUN CONTROL LEGISLATION.
NO ONE FROM NEW YORK ORWASHINGTON TELLS ME WHAT TO DO.
>> I'LL MAKE SURE PRESIDENTOBAMA GETS THE MESSAGE.
[GUNFIRE][LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WELL, I HAD NO IDEATHE WHITE HOUSE HAD SUCH AN
ACCESSIBLE, UH, ACMECOMPANY-LIKE OFF SWITCH.
SEEMS LIKE A WEAKNESS IN OURNATION'S ELECTRICAL GRID, NOT TO
MENTION AN INCONVENIENCE FOR THEPRESIDENT. I MEAN, HOW MANY
TIMES ARE YOU JUST SITTINGAROUND THE HOUSE, YOU KNOW,
TRYING THE READSOMETHING AND THEN, DOH!
YOU KNOW, THESE REPUBLICANATTACK ADS ARE JUST GETTING
SILLIER AND -- I'M BEING TOLDTHE CANDIDATES IN THOSE ADS ARE
DEMOCRATS.
BUT EVEN THOUGH DEMOCRATICCANDIDATES ARE THROWING THE
PRESIDENT SHADE, THAT ISN'TSTOPPING HIM FROM WORKING ON
THEIR BEHALF.
>> IN COLORADO PRESIDENT OBAMASHOWED UP FOR A FUND-RAISING
EVENT LAST WEEK. A FUND-RAISINGEVENT FOR DEMOCRATIC SENATOR
MARK UDALL. WELL, MARK UDALLWAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
>> Jon: OH, THAT STINGS A BIT,BUT IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO
SHAME OBAMA BY NOT WANTING TO BESEEN WITH HIM IN PUBLIC, THE MAN
HAS TWO TEENAGE DAUGHTERS.
[LAUGHTER]I THINK HE'S FAMILIAR WITH THE
CONCEPT OF BEING SHUNNED.
DAD, CAN YOU NOT PRESIDENT JUSTONE TIME IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS.
JUST PLEASE.
YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.
THAT'S A PITCH PERFECTIMPRESSION.
>> AMONG THE DEMOCRATS RUNNINGFROM OBAMA, KENTUCKY SENATE
CANDIDATE ALLISON GRIMES UPAGAINST FIVE TERM SENATE
MINORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL.
McCONNELL HAS A LOT OF STRIKESAGAINST HIM. HE'S THE FACE OF
REPUBLICAN OBSTRUCTIONISM, ASTALWART PROTECTOR OF
BIG BUSINESS AND HE SOUNDSEXACTLY LIKE THIS, "I SURE WOULD
LIKE... I SURE WOULD LIKE TO BEELECTED FOR MY SIXTH TERM."
[LAUGHTER]HOLD ON!
"YEP."
YEP, THAT'S EXACTLY HOW HESOUNDS.
BUT GRIMES, GRIMES ISN'T WITHOUTSOME SKELETONS IN HER CLOSET.
>> GRIMES' FATHER HAS BECOME ANISSUE, TOO.
HE OWNS HUGH JASS BURGERS INLEXINGTON.
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
HUGH JASS BURGERS, A KENTUCKYSTAPLE JUST AROUND THE CORNER
FROM ANOTHER FAMOUS KENTUCKYESTABLISHMENT, E. NORMA'S
WEINERS.
THAT ONE'S NOT REAL.
SO HER FATHER OWNS A WAGGISHLYPUNNED ESTABLISHMENT.
HOW BAD CAN THAT BE?
>> THE MENU INCLUDES ABBY'S HUGHJASS, NAME AFTER HIS DAUGHTER
ABIGAIL, AND CHARLOTTE'S RACK, AREFERENCE TO BARBECUE AND HIS
WIFE.
>> Jon: MY GODDAUGHTER'S TATERTITS, AUNT SOPHIE'S CRUSTY
MUFFIN.
I HATE MY FAMILY.
[LAUGHTER]SO ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES IS
ASSOCIATED WITH A DISREPUTABLEORGANIZATION THAT FLAUNTS ITS
CONTEMPT FOR WOMEN, AND THEOTHER HAS A DAD THAT OWNS HUGH
JASS BURGERS.
BOOM! HASHTAG YES ALL BURGERS.
WHAT IF YOUR OPPONENT'S DADDOESN'T OWN A HILARIOUSLY
NAMED FAST FOOD JOINT?
YOU COULD GO WITH ARKANSASSENTATOR MARK PRYOR'S STRATEGY
AGAINST HIS OPPONENT TOM COTTON.
>> TOM COTTON VOTED AGAINSTPREPARING AMERICA FOR PANDEMICS
LIKE EBOLA.
>> HE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO VOTEAGAINST CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS.
>> MY OPPONENT IS PRO EBOLA ANDANTI-BABY.
WELL, THAT CERTAINLY HAS TO BETHE MOST PREJORTIVE AND
ACCUSATORY AD IN THE SENATERACES, YOU WOULD THINK.
IF YOU DIDN'T LIVE IN ALASKA.
>> ALASKA TURNED UGLY.
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARKBEGICH RELEASED THIS AD
CRITICIZING REPUBLICANCHALLENGER DAN SULLIVAN.
>> I WANT TO SHOW YOU A CRIMESCENE.
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG DANSULLIVAN LIVED IN ALASKA, BUT I
KNOW WHAT HE DID AS ATTORNEYGENERAL. HE LET A LOT OF SEX
OFFENDERS GET OFF OFLIGHT SENTENCES.
ONE OF THEM GOT OUT OF PRISON,IS NOW CHARGED WITH BREAKING
INTO THAT APARTMENT BUILDING,MURDERED A SENIOR COUPLE.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: HOLY CRAP, MARK BEGICH'S
OPPONENT DAN SULLIVAN IS LIKE AONE-MAN, LAW AND ORDER S.U.V.
PLOT GENERATOR.
SVU, I MEAN OBVIOUSLY NOT S.U.V.
S.U.V. WOULD BE JUST A GUY IN ATRUCK.
[LAUGHTER]YOU TRY AND READ.
HOW CAN A GUY LIKE THAT EVENDARE TO RUN UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THERE'S SOME MITIGATINGCIRCUMSTANCES THAT DUE TO THE
TIME CONSTRAINTS OF THATCAMPAIGN AD WAS NOT INCLUDED
THAT MAY SHED SOME EXONERATINGLIGHT ON SULLIVAN.
>> A CLERICAL ERROR WAS TOBLAME FOR THE MURDER SUSPECT'S
EARLY RELEASE BEFORE SULLIVANTOOK OFFICE.
>> OH, WELL THEN I GUESS ITAPPEARS SULLIVAN HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH IT, BUT I GUESS, WELLTHAT'S FOR THE VOTERS TO DECIDE.
WHAT'S SULLIVAN'S TAKE ONTHE RACE?
>> MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OFNEGATIVE ADS ARE FLOODING INTO
ALASKA, PAID FOR BY WASHINGTONSPECIAL INTERESTS.
PRETTY SOON YOU'RE GOING TO WANTTO DO THIS TO YOUR TV.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: OR YOU COULD TURN IT
OFF.
[LAUGHTER]BUT THAT'S YOUR CHOICE, ALASKA.
YOU CAN VOTE FOR A GUY WHO LIESIN HIS CAMPAIGN ADS OR HIS
OPPONENT, THE WEIRD GUY DOWN ATTHE EDGE OF TOWN WHO SHOOTS HIS
APPLIANCES WHEN THEY DISPLEASEHIM.
TOASTER.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
