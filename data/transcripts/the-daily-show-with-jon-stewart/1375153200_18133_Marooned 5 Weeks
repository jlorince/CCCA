>> John: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW.
MY NAME IS JOHN OLIVER.
I AM STILL SITTING IN FOR JON
STEWART WHO IS AWAY THIS SUMMER
FILMING A "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC"
SPECIAL SLOWLY GAINING THE TRUST
OF A FAMILY OF MEERCATS.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, MARK LEAVE
VEITCH AUTHOR OF "THIS TOWN" IS
WITH US.
IT'S A BRILLIANT EXPOSE OF HOW
WASHINGTON D.C. TURNS OUT TO BE
EXACTLY AS AWFUL AS EVERYONE
THINKS IT IS.
BUT WE START TONIGHT IN RUSSIA.
WITH EDWARD SNOWDEN, THE FORMER
N.S.A. CONTRACTOR TURNED WHISTLE
BLOWER AND ALSO OF THE UPCOMING
LONELY PLANET TERMINAL-D OF THE
MOSCOW AIRPORT.
SO WHAT HAS HE BEEN UP TO APART
FROM NOTHING?
>> RUSSIAN NEWS AGENCIES
REPORTED THAT SNOWDEN WOULD GET
A SPECIAL I.D. CARD OR DOCUMENT
OF SOME KIND THAT WOULD ALLOW
HIM TO FINALLY LEAVE THE AIRPORT
TRANSIT ZONE.
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE LAWYER
WASN'T CARRYING ANY SUCH I.D.
CARD.
HE DID HAVE SOME FRESH CLOTHES
FOR US, SOME PIZZA AND A COUPLE
OF BOOKS BY CHECK OFTEN.
>> John: THAT'S NICE BECAUSE
NOTHING LIGHTENS A MAN'S SPIRITS
LIKE THEODORE.
I THINK YOU'LL FIND HIM IN
BARNES AND ENABLE'S MISERY
SECTION.
TAKE THAT.
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND SUFFERING.
I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM WITH YOU,
CHECKOV.
NO PROBLEM.
BUT LIKE A HOTEL PHONE RINGING
AT 5:30 A.M. BECAUSE YOU
SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED IT,
SNOWDEN HAS PROVIDED A REAL
WAKE-UP CALL.
(LAUGHING).
HE'S FORCED AMERICANS TO EXAMINE
THE TRADE-OFFS WE'VE MADE
BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITY AND
NOT HAVING THE GOVERNMENT LISTEN
INTO OUR PRIVATE PHONE CALLS
WITH 55 [BLEEP].
I TOLD THAT IN CONFIDENCE ABOUT
MY PRIVATE MEDICAL HISTORY.
I'M CONCERNED.
I'M CLEARLY NOT THE ONLY ONE
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS LEVEL OF
GOVERNMENT INTRUSION.
>> NEW NBC WALL STREET JOURNAL
POLL SHOWS THE PUBLIC GROWING
MORE WEARY KNOW THE GOVERNMENT
COULD GO TOO FAR IN ITS
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS AND
VIOLATE PRIVACY RIGHTS.
FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW A
MAJORITY 56% NOW SAY THEY ARE
WORRIED THAT THE U.S. MONITORING
PROGRAMS WILL GO TOO FAR.
>> John: RIGHT.
AND THE REALLY CONCERNING THING
THERE, THE DATA GATHERED IN THAT
POLL DIDN'T COME THROUGH A
SURVEY.
THEY JUST KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
NOW.
LUCKILY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE IN
CONGRESS WHO ARE PAYING
ATTENTION.
>> WITHIN THE LAST HOUR
STATEMENTS FROM REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSMAN JUSTIN AMASH AND THE
RANKING DEMOCRAT ON THE HOUSE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE JON CONYERS
WHO ARE INTRODUCING LEGISLATION
TO LIMIT THE COLLECTION OF PHONE
RECORDS AND TO FORCE SECRET
NATIONAL SECURITY COURT OPINIONS
TO BE PUBLIC.
>> THIS STRANGE COALITION, VERY
LIBERAL AND VERY CONSERVATIVE.
YOU DON'T OFTEN HEAR THAT THESE
DAYS.
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT.
NOT ONLY IS CONGRESS ACTUALLY
RESPONDING TO THIS CANDLE,
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE
WORKING TOGETHER.
THAT FEELS STRANGE.
IT'S LIKE WHEN AN ANIMAL BECOMES
FRIENDS WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
ANIMAL.
IT'S LOVELY TO SEE BUT SOMETHING
ABOUT IT JUST FEELS WRONG.
SURE, MAYBE THEY'RE GOING TO
WORK TOGETHER TO GET A BANANA
OUT OF A TREE BUT CALL ME
CYNICAL.
ONCE THAT FRUIT HITS THE GROUND
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH A
DEAD BIRD AND A BLIND MONKEY.
