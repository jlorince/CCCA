>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,
WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT ONE OF OUR
FAVORITES COLIN FIRTH WILL BE
HERE PROMOTING HIS WONDERFUL NEW
FILM.
IT'S CALLED "THE CONTINUING'S
SPEECH."
IF I MAY JUST DO A PIECE FROM
IT.
AGAIN, I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT A GREAT
ACTOR.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT I SAW THE FILM AND I WAS SO
MOVED BY IT.
THE ONE SCENE WHERE HE ADDRESSES
THE ENGLISH PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE
OF WORLD WAR II BRINGING A
CERTAIN SOLACE HE STAYED WITH
THEM IN BUCKINGHAM PALACE AS HE
COULD HAVE GONE TO THE COUNTRY
WHERE THE GERMANS WERE BOMBING
IT.
WENT LIKE THIS.
ARWOOOOO, THE BOMBS, OOOOH.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
