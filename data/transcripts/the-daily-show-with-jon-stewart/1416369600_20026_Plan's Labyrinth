>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW. MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
MY GUEST TONIGHT, THIS ISEXCITING.
A YOUNG MAN NAMED BENEDICTCUMBERBATCH IS GOING TO JOIN US.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]GREAT FILM. IT'S A GREAT FILM,
AND HE'S GREAT IN IT.
BUT FIRST IT'S BEEN A ROUGH YEARFOR THE PRESIDENT OF THESE
UNITED STATES.
THE RISE OF ISIS. A MIDTERMSHELLACKING.
THE FAILURE TO GET EVEN ONECHAIR TO TURN AROUND ON
"THE VOICE." JUST ONE! COME ONGWEN, TURN AROUND!
BARACK IS SINGING!
BUT AS THE PRESIDENT SAID IN HIS"VOICE" AUDITION SONG
â™ª THE SUN WILL COME OUT -->> A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE
SIGNED UP FOR OBAMA CARE ONSATURDAY, THE VERY FIRST DAY
OF THE LATEST DAY OF THE RECENTOPEN ENROLLMENT.
>> THE CONSUMER HAS A BETTERINTERACTION.
THINGS ARE SIMPLER, FASTER ANDMORE INTUITIVE.
>> Jon: OBAMACARE WEBSITE ISBETTER.
FOR EXAMPLE, NOW WHEN YOU LOGINTO THE NEW HEALTHCARE.GOV IT
OFFERS YOU A CHOICE OF INSURANCEOPTIONS RATHER THAN BRUNCH
OPTIONS FOR A DENNYS INKALAMAZOO.
ALSO THE NEW WEBSITE LOADSQUICKLY.
WHEREAS THE OLD SITE WOULDCUT THE BRAKES IN YOUR CAR.
SHE'S TERRIFIED.
AGAIN IT'S A BIG IMPROVEMENT.
I BET ALL ANYONE IN WASHINGTONDC WILL TALK ABOUT THESE
AMAZING SUCCESS OF OBAMACARE.
>> ALL ANYONE IN WASHINGTON ISTALKING ABOUT IS A TAPE THAT
EMERGED RECENTLY OF AN OBAMACARECONSULTANT TELLING FOLKS
WHAT HE REALLY THINKS ABOUT THEAMERICANS BUYING THE INSURANCE.
>> Jon: OH, I BET HE THINKSTHEY'RE REALLY NEAT.
[LAUGHING]ACTUALLY THEY'RE
RETPEFRG TO OBAMA CARECONSULTANT JON GRUBER.
THAT'S ACTUALLY JON GRUDEN.
THAT'S FORMER BUCK'SCOACH JOHN GRUDEN.
THAT'S JOHN McCLANE'SNEMESIS HANS GRUBER.
THAT'S JUST A -- THAT'S JUSTA POPULAR CINEMA SNACK, GOOBERS.
THAT'S -- THANK YOU. SO WHAT DIDTHIS GUY SAY ABOUT OBAMACARE?
>> IT'S A VERY CLEVER, YOU KNOW,BASIC EXPLOITATION OF THE LACK
OF ECONOMIC UNDERSTANDING OFTHE AMERICAN VOTER.
THEY PROPOSED IT AND THATPASSED. BECAUSE THE AMERICAN
VOTERS ARE TOO STUPID TOUNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE.
>> Jon: WHAT, HOW, WHAT!
WHAT!
HOW DARE THIS GRUBER!
SAY AMERICANS ARE STUPID.
[LAUGHING]WE CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE
SEVEN SUBTLY DIFFERENTFLAVORS OF COMBOS.
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ALL JUSTBASICALLY HOLLOWED OUT LINCOLN
LOGS SOMEONE JIZZED IN.
I'M SORRY, I MEAN PRETZELSWITH CHEESE.
WHO IS THIS JERK,GRUBER ANYWAYS ?
>> JONATHAN GRUBER IS ANECONOMICS PROFESSOR.
>> Jon: EGGHEAD.
>> HE HAS SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFEIN ACADEMIA.
>> Jon: SUPER EGGHEAD.
NERD PUNCHING ARM ACTIVATE.
>> GRUBER WORKS IN MASSACHUSETS.
>> Jon: TAXACHUSETS!
SUPER TAXACHUSETS EGGHEAD! ALLWE NEED TO WIN PROGRESSIVE
BOOGEYMAN BINGO IS FOR THIS MANTO HAVE THE PINCHED NASAL
TONE OF CLASSIC MOVIENERD, EDDIE DEEZEN.
>> BOY ARE YOU GUYS DUMB.
THAT SYSTEM PROBABLY CONTAINS ANEW DATA ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM.
>> Jon: WELL?
DOES HE?
>> THIS BILL WAS WRITTEN IN ATORTURED WAY TO MAKE SURE
CBO DID NOT SCORE THE MANDATE ASTAXES.
IF CBO SCORED THE MANDATE ASTAXES, THE BILL DIES.
LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IS A HUGEPOLITICAL ADVANTAGE.
AND BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, CALL ITTHE STUPIDITY OF THE AMERICAN
VOTER, OR WHATEVER.BUT BASICALLY THAT WAS REALLY,
REALLY CRITICAL TO GET ANYTHINGTO PASS.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: HOLY [BEEP]!
[LAUGHING]SO THIS GUY EDDIE DEEZEN,  I
MEAN GRUBER.
THIS GUY SAYS THAT THE AMERICANPEOPLE WERE PURPOSELY MISLEAD
ABOUT OBAMACARE.
WELL LET ME ASK ANOTHERQUESTION.
WHO THE [BEEP] IS HE?
BY A COMPLETE PERIPHERAL PLAYER.
President: WE HAVE DRAWN SOMEOF THE BRIGHTEST MINDS OF
ACADEMIA AND POLICY CIRCLES.
MANY OF THEM I HAVE STOLEN IDEASFROM LIBERALLY.
PEOPLE FROM ROBERT GORDON TOAUSTAN GOOLSBEE AND JON GRUBER.
>> HE ATTENDED FIVE OF THETWELVE MEETINGS AT THE OBAMA
WHITE HOUSE IN 2009 INCLUDINGTHE MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT.
>> WHEN THE BILL WAS BEINGWRITTEN THE ADMINISTRATION PAID
GRUBER ALMOST $400,000 FORTECHNICAL ADVICE ON DRAFTING THE
LAW.
>> Jon: THE WHITE HOUSECAFETERIA HAS A SANDWICH NOW
CALLED THE GRUBERGER.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITEDSTATES HAS A NECKLACE IT'S A
BROKEN MEDALLION.
THE OTHER HALF OF THAT MEDALLIONRESIDES ON THE PERSON OF ONE
JON GRUBER.
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT AND JONGRUBER TALKING ABOUT OBAMA CARE
OVER LUNCH.
[LAUGHING]SO, I DON'T WANT TO TELL
YOU HOW THAT ENDS.
SO THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIPTOLD US, THE DEMOCRATIC
LEADERSHIP TOLD US THAT THEINDIVIDUAL MANDATE IN THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS NOT ATAX EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW IT WAS
A TAX.
THAT'S PRETTY SLIMY.
I GUESS ALL THEY CAN DO NOW ISGO BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND SAY, ALRIGHT.
WE MISLED YOU.
IT WAS FOR THE GREATER GOOD.
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR PARENTS TELLYOU THAT YOUR DOG
MR. MITTENS DIDN'T DIE HE JUSTWENT UPSTATE TO LIVE ON A FARM.
BUT YOU DIDN'T SAY GOODBYEBECAUSE APPARENTLY HE HAD A
MEETING THERE AT 3:00 IN THE[BLEEP] MORNING.
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND YOUNEVER EXPLAINED WHY SCHNAUZERS
WERE HAVING A MEETING IN THEFIRST PLACE.
THE POINT IS I MISS YOUMR. MITTENS.
[LAUGHING] ALSO I THINK THE
DEMOCRATS CAN NOW COME CLEANABOUT HOW THE BILL WAS SOLD AND
MR. GRUBER'S INVOLVEMENT IN THATPROCESS.
OR -->> WE HAVE NEWS HERE IN THE PAST
FEW DAYS ABOUT SOME OFTHE COMMENTS MADE BY MR. GRUBER.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: CAN YOU EVER NOT, NOT
DISAPPOINT US?
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS.
>> OUR BILL BRINGS DOWN RATES.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEENJONATHAN GRUBER OF MIT'S
ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE COMPARISONIS TO THE STATUS QUO.
>> Jon: WHOEVER THAT GUY IS.
SO, THAT'S PRETTY LOUSY.
POLITICALLY.
BUT GRUBER STILL ISN'T DOING ANYSTRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO THE ACT,
UNLESS IN ONE OF HIS CAUGHT ONTAPE RAMBLINGS HE SAID SOMETHING
THAT HACKED AWAY AT OBAMACARE'SACTUAL INNER WORKINGS.
>> THROUGH A POLITICALCOMPROMISE THE DECISION WAS MADE
THAT STATES SHOULD PLAY ACRITICAL ROLL IN RUNNING
THE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES.AND THE HEALTH INSURANCE
EXCHANGES ARE THE CENTERPIECEOF THIS REFORM.
IF YOU'RE A STATE AND YOU DON'TSET UP YOUR EXCHANGE,
THAT MEANS YOUR CITIZENSDON'T GET THEIR TAX CREDITS.
>> Jon: OH, BOY. GRUBER HERESEEMS TO BE SUGGESTING
THAT THE LAW ONLY PROVIDESSUBSIDIES TO LOWER INCOME
INDIVIDUALS TO HELP THEMPAY FOR THEIR INSURANCE THROUGH
STATE EXCHANGES NOT THE FEDERALEXCHANGE.
AND SINCE THE FEDERAL EXCHANGECOVERS 36 STATES THAT WOULD
EFFECTLY SCRAP THE AFFORDABLEPART OF
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
BUT HERE IS THE THING.THAT'S IF YOU LOOK AT JUST ONE
CLAUSE AND IGNORE THE REST OFTHE LAW BECAUSE THE ACA ALSO
STATES THAT WHEN STATES FAIL TOSTEP UP AND CREATE THE REQUIRED
EXCHANGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT"SHALL ESTABLISH AND OPERATE
SUCH A EXCHANGE WITHIN THESTATE." AND ACCORDING TO A
BIPARTISAN GROUP OF NEARLY 50EXPERTS IN HEALTH ECONOMY,
NOTHING IN THE RECORDS SUGGESTSTHAT CONGRESS INTENDED THE
ECONOMICALLY DISASTROUS APPROACHOF DRAMATICALLY LIMITING
SUBSIDIES ONLY TO PARTICIPANTSOF THE STATE EXCHANGES.
SO REALLY IT'S A MATTER OFINTERPRETATION.
EITHER THE LAW INTENDS FOR THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE
SUBSIDIES THROUGH STATEEXCHANGES OR CONGRESS
INTENTIONALLY WROTE A BILLDESIGNED TO KILL ITSELF.
AND SURE, CONGRESS SUCKS.
THEY CAN'T SUCK THAT BAD.
SO, TO THE REPUBLICANS, YOU'VETRIED TO KILL THIS LAW EVERY
WHICH WAY.
50,000 CONGRESSIONAL REPEALS,DEFUNDING THREATS, LAWSUITS UP
THE WAZOO WHICH BY THE WAY,FULLY COVERED NOW UNDER
OBAMACARE. YOU KEEP TRYING.
BUT NOW YOUR BEST REMAININGMOVE, THE STRONGEST CARD IN THE
DECK LOOKS TO BE THE GRUBER.
GOOD LUCK GETTING SOMEONE TOTAKE UP A FEDERAL CASE ON THE
OFFHANDED AND SOMEWHAT DICKISHCOMMENTS OF SOME MIT EGGHEAD.
>> THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR ACHALLENGE TO OBAMACARE NEXT
YEAR THAT COULD INVALIDATEFEDERALLY OPERATED EXCHANGES
IN 30 STATES.
>> OPPONENTS OF THE LAW, YOUKNOW, REALLY SEIZED ON GRUBER'S
COMMENTS EVEN THOUGH THEY WEREMADE A YEAR AGO.
AND THEY'RE GOING TO USE THAT INTHE SUPREME COURT.
[LAUGHING]>> Jon: WELL, IN THE WORDS OF A
PREVIOUS SUPREME COURT CASE[BEEP] [BEEP] [BEEP] AND
TITS.
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
