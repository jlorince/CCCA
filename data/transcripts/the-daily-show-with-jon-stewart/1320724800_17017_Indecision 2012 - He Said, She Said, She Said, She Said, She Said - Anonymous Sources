I OWE TIM MONEY IS WHAT I DO.
THE PROBLEM FOR CAIN EXCEPT
FOR THE OCCASIONAL TYPICAL
MEDIA (BEEP)....
>> JUST WHO IS HERMAN CAIN'S
WIFE AND WHY HASN'T SHE SAID
ANYTHING YET?
>> Jon: BRING US THE WIFE OF
THE ACCUSED.
SO THAT WE MAY THROW TOMATOES
AT HER AS WELL.
THE PROBLEM FOR CAIN IS THAT
FOR THE MOST PART THE BIG GET
OF THE POLITICAL STORY WAS
TRUE.
THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT
ASSOCIATION DID PAY A BUNCH OF
MONEY TO TWO LADIES TO SETTLE
HARASSMENT CLAIMS AGAINST
HERMAN CAIN.
WHICH BY THE WAY EVEN HERMAN
CAIN SEEMED TO KNOW ABOUT IN
2003.
>> IN 2003 HERMAN CAIN RAN FOR
THE SENATE.
HE HIRED A GENERAL CONSULTANT,
KURT ANDERSON.
MR. CAIN DIVULGED THE
N.R.A.CLAIMS AT THAT TIME TO
HIS GENERAL CONSULTANT.
>> THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT
ASSOCIATION.
>> EXACTLY.
MR. ANDERSON.
SO THE CAMPAIGN AT THAT POINT
WOULD BE PREPARED IF THE ISSUE
SURFACED.
>> Jon: BY 2011, HIS MEMORY
HADÃ±r BECOME... ALL FADED.
>> I AM UNAWARE OF ANY SORT OF
SETTLEMENT.
I HOPE IT WASN'T FOR MUCH
BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
>> Jon: OH, YOU DIDN'T?
THAT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE THEY
PAID HER $482 MILLION.
AND THE SECOND PROBLEM WITH
HERMAN CAIN'S BLAME THE MEDIA
STORY LINE IS THAT THE FIRST
PLACE CABLE NEWS NETWORK IS
DOING THE BEST TO HELP HIM.
>> DO YOU THINK OTHERS IN THE
MEDIA HAVE BEEN GIVING TOO
MUCH CREDENCE TO THESE RIGHT
NOW ANONYMOUS ALLEGATIONS?
POLITICO CHOSE NOT TO NAME THE
WOMEN INVOLVED IN THESE TWO
CASES WHICH I FOUND
INTERESTING.
>> Jon: VERY INTERESTING.
ANYONE WHO USED ANONYMOUS
SOURCES SHOULD BE DRUMMED OUT
OF JUMBLISM UNLESS....
>> AN UNNAMED SENIOR WHITE
HOUSE OFFICIAL TELLS POLITICO
THE UNION FLUSHED TEN MILLION
OF THEIR MEMBERS' MONEY DOWN
THE TOILET ON A POINTLESS
EXERCISE.
THAT'S A QUOTE.
MANY BELIEVE IT'S FROM RAHM
EMANUEL.
ALL POLITICO SAYS IS SENIOR
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL.
IS THE LOVE AFFAIR BETWEEN THE
WHITE HOUSE AND ORGANIZED
LABOR OVER?
>> Jon: YOU'RE JUST GOING TO
RUN WITH IT.
ALL RIGHT.
TO BE FAIR THAT'S NOT
ANONYMOUS, OF COURSE.
MANY BELIEVE IT'S RAHM
EMANUEL.
THAT WAS KIND OF EASY.
A LOT OF POLITICAL STORIES USE
ANONYMOUS SOURCING.
THE REAL TRICK FOR OUR CRACK
RESEARCH TEAM WOULD BE TO USE
ANONYMOUS SOURCES TO DISCREDIT
A REPORT YOU HAVE DISMISSED
BECAUSE IT HAS USED ANONYMOUS
SOURCES.
BUT TO FIND A CLIP LIKE THAT,
IT WOULD BE LIKE THE HOLY
GRAIL.
A PIPE DREAM.
ROLL THAT CLIP.
>> THE STORY CAME FROM
ANONYMOUS SOURCES.
SO IF THAT THEORY IS TRUE WE
SHOULD GO BACK AND SAY WELL
THEN HOW DID THIS STORY EVER
SURFACE BECAUSE DID IT COME
FROM SOURCES WHO WILL GO ON
THE RECORD?
NO.
I DON'T THINK THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WILL BE HAPPY WITH
FINDING OUT WHO PLANTED THE
STORY AND HAPPY WITH THE
PERSON WHO DID IT.
>> THE WORD IS FROM THE
WASHINGTON TIMES THAT
ACCORDING TO A SOURCE WHOSE
FRIENDS WITH THE CAIN CAMP NOT
ONLY IS RICK PERRY CAMPAIGN
INVOLVED BUT THE MAYOR OF
CHICAGO, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF
RAHM EMANUEL IS LIKELY
INVOLVED WITH THE SEXUAL
HARASSMENT ACCUSER ATTACKS.
>> Jon: ANONYMOUS SOURCES ARE
HORRIBLE.
I KNOW.
THIS ANONYMOUS SOURCE SAYS THE
CODE OF JOURNALISM IS SIMPLY
THIS.
IT'S NOT OKAY TO USE AN
ANONYMOUS SOURCE.
UNLESS IT'S ABOUT RAHM
EMANUEL.
