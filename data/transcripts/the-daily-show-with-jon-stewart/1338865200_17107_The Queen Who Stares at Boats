THAT IS IT.
THE MAIN STORY COMES FROM A CELEBRATION ACROSS THE POND.
>> THE BOAT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A FLOTILLA HONORING QUEEN ELIZABETH, DRESSED IN WHITE AS
SHE CELEBRATED 60 YEARS ON THE THRONE.
>> Jon: 60 YEARS ON THE THRONE.
GET THAT WOMAN SOME FIBER.
IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT SPECTACLE.
YOU COULD ALMOST SEE THROUGH THE INSIDE OF A CAR WASH THAT IS ENGLAND IN JUNE.
>> WHEN THE ORCHESTRA STARTS UP,
PRINCE PHILIP JOINS IN.
CAMILLA TAKES THEIR LEAD AND THE FAMILY DANCED.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT DANCING.
THEY'RE SHIVERING.
PEOPLE CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FUN AND HYPOTHERMIA?
OF COURSE, THE MAJORITY OF AMERICA'S MEDIA STILL RECOVERING FROM LAST YEAR'S POMP AND
CIRCUMSTANCE OVER THE ROYAL WEDDING.
ONLY CNN WENT FULL FLOTILLA WITH TWO SOLID HOURS OF COVERAGE THAT COULD BEST BE DESCRIBED AS...
>> AN ORGY OF EXCITEMENT.
Jon: YES.
AN ORGY.
QUEEN ELIZABETH'S DIAMOND JUBILEE WAS A [BLEEP]FEST OF MARVELOUSNESS.
IT WAS A GANG BANG OF AWESOME.
SORT OF WHAT YOU AND I APPEARED TO BE TUG BOAT AND GARBAGE BARGES FESS TOONED IN
PAPIER-MACHE DRIFTING IN CELEBRATION OF A DURABLE OLD LADY'S CONTINUED NON-DEATH WAS
TO THE TRAINED JOURNALIST'S HIGH MUCH, MUCH MORE.
>> I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SPECTACLE QUITE LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE.
>> I'VE SEEN QUITE A FEW ROYAL OCCASIONS OVER THE YEARS BUT NOTHING QUITE LIKE THIS.
>> EXTRAORDINARY.
THIS IS FANTASTIC.
AMAZING.
BSOLUTELY AMAZING.
THIS IS CRAZY STUFF.
WHAT AN AMAZING THING.
IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?
'M PRACTICALLY SPEECHLESS.
THIS IS BRITAIN AT ITS BEST.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
IT'S PULLING THE 360 WE HAD ONLY HEARD ABOUT.
>> A RAPID FIRE 360 TURN.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY BOAT THAT SIZE DO THIS.
ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE.
>> Jon: I'M GETTING WORD THERE'S A SCHOONER DOING A K-TURN.
A SCHOONER.
IS THIS SOMEHOW THE BRITISH EQUIVALENT OF A MONSTER TRUCK SHOW?
COME DOWN TO THE THAMES AND SEE A ROTATING BOAT.
OUTSTANDING.
IF YOU THINK THE FLOTILLA IS EXCITING, JUST WAIT UNTIL CNN GETS A LOW LOAD OF WHAT'S
HAPPENING COME.
>> THE GRAND FINALE WHERE THE QUEEN WILL BE WITNESSING FOR THE FLY-BY.
>> IT WILL BE SPECTACULAR.
-PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY.
THE MOST SPECTACULAR PART OF THE WHOLE THING.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED THE QUEEN FOR NOT SMILING AS MUCH.
BUT YOU SAY WE WILL DEFINITELY BE SEEING A SMILE ONCE WE SEE THAT FLYOVER IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.
>> Jon: IT'S THE ONLY THING STILL KEEPING HER ALIVE.
THE FLY-BY.
IT'S LIKE BOATS IN THE SKY.
IT WILL MAKE THE WHOLE MISERABLE DAY WORTH IT.
>> WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS.
Jon: OH, NO.
BREAKING NEWS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
CNN.
THERE WAS THAT TRAGIC PLANE CRASH IN NIGERIA AT THE EXACT SAME TIME WITH THOSE TERRIBLE CASUALTIES.
THIS IS WHERE REAL LIFE INTRUDES ON THE FAIRY TALE, PROBABLY WHERE CNN CUTS AWAY AND WE'LL
GET BITS AND PIECES OF TAPED RECAST.
CNN GOES WALL TO WALL ON THE TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.
>> SADLY THE FLY-BY HAS BEEN CANCELED.
DUE TO THE AWFUL CONDITIONS, THE ROYAL NAVY HAS JUST CONFIRMED TO US THAT THERE WILL BE NOFULLY-BY
WHICH IS VERY, VERY SAD.
>> Jon: YES.
IT WAS ONE OF THE TWO VERY SAD AIRPLANE STORIES OF THE DAY.
YOU HATE TO BE THE GUY WHOSE JOB IT IS TO CANCEL THEFULLY-BY THOUGH.
DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS, YOUR MAJESTY, WE HAD TO CANCEL THE...
SO NO BIG FLY-BY.
YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE FIREWORKS.
>> Jon: I'M
