>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY SHOW".
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
NICE PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT.
FRESH OFF A GELDEN GLOBES VICTORY, JESSICA CHASTAIN IS GOING TO BE HERE FROM THE FILM
"ZERO DARK THIRTY".
I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL IT FOR ANYBODY BUT KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BIN LADEN CHARACTER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, LISTEN, AS YOU KNOW FOLLOWING A SERIES OF TERRIBLE GUN TRAGEDIES IN THIS COUNTRY IN
LET'S CALL IT 30 YEARS OF YOU ARE BAR WARFARE, AMERICA IS IN THE MIDST OF A SERIOUS
CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS.
THE NRA HAS BEEN CLEAR THOUGHT WOULD MEET ANY GUN LAWS WITH SERIOUS RESISTANCE.
>> THEY ARE GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT RNCHT PRESIDENT'S KIDS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOURS?
WHY IS HE SKEPTICAL BUT PUTTING ARMED SECURITY IN SCHOOLS WHEN HIS KIDS ARE PROTECTED AT THEIR SCHOOLS?
>> Jon: AND WHY DOES HE GET TO VETO BILLS AND COMMAND AN ARMY WHEN WE DON'T?
ALL RIGHT SO THE CONVERSATION HAS STARTED AND WE'RE OFF TO A DEPLORABLE START.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I SWEAR TO YOU IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER AND I'M NOT A BIG CONSPIRACY GUY, I WOULD THINK
THE NRA IS AN ELABORATE AFTER VANT GEARD JOAQUIN PHOENIX STYLE JOKE OR A FALSE FLAG OPERATION
RUN BY MICHAEL MOORE IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISCREDIT RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS.
YOUR RESPONSE, MR. PRESIDENT.
>> I BELIEVE THE SECOND AMENDMENT GUARANTEES AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
I BELIEVE MOST GUN OWNERS AGREE WE CAN RESPECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHILE KEEPING AN
IRRESPONSIBLE LAW BREAKING FEW FROM INFLICTING HARM ON A MASSIVE SCALE.
>> Jon: INTERESTING OPEN ON HIS PART.
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO SAY IF YOU BRING UP MY KIDS AGAIN I'LL DRUM STRIKE YOU'RE (bleep) TO
KINGDOM COME.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
HE UNVEILED LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND 23 ACTIONS TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE
INCLUDING LIMITING MAGAZINE SIZE, RESTRICTING ASSAULT WEAPONS, EXPAND BACKGROUND
CHECKS AND ODDLY ENOUGH PROVIDE MONEY FOR INCREASED SCHOOL SECURITY WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY
THAT REALLY CHARMING AD.
HOW DID HIS RECOMMENDATION GOES DOWN WITH THE PRO-GUN CROWD?
>> ALL THE THINGS HE POINTED OUT WILL ONLY AFFECT LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHO ALREADY ABIDE ABOUT
IT LAW.
WE HAVE OVER 20,000 GUN LAWS ON THE BOOKS.
WE NEED TO ENFORCE THOSE GUN LAWS.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW THAT IS -- OKAY.
THAT'S TRUE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT HAPPEN IT'S BE ENTIRELY ACCURATE.
WE NEED TO ENFORCE THOSE 20,000 LAWS.
UNLESS THEY TAKE THAT ENFORCEMENT JOB ON THEMSELVES SLOW DOWN, THERE'S NO NEED.
FORMER KANSAS CONGRESSMAN TODD TIAHRT POINTED OUT WHY MAYORS SHOULD NOT BE TRYING TO TRACE
WHERE ILLEGAL GUNS ARE COMING FROM.
>> WHEN CRIMES ARE COMMITTED OR A DEALER SELLING GUNS ILLEGALLY WE HAVE AN ORGANIZATION THAT
GOES AFTER THEM 4/7 EVERY DAY.
IT'S CALLED THE ATF AND THEY HAVE OFFICERS COMPLETELY ASSIGNED TO DO THIS.
>> Jon: THE ATF, THE BUREAU, ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS.
IT'S AN ACTUAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY NOT JUST A TRADITIONAL SOUTHERN WEDDING GIFT.
LOOK --
[ LAUGHTER ]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- I WOULD LIKE -- I WOULD LIKE -- DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE REGISTERED REALLY.
ALTHOUGH WHEN YOU GET THOSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE REGISTERED.
THAT'S THE BEAUTY.
I WOULD LIKE THE ATF'S DIRECTOR TO EXPLAIN TO YOU IF YOU ARE OUT THERE 24 SLRK 7 WHY IS THIS
COUNTRY ASS DEEP IN ILLEGAL GUN?
>> WE'VE NOT HAD A DIRECTOR OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIRE FOR SIX YEARS.
>> Jon: SURE.
I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THE CAPTAIN CAN'T HAVE SUGARY DRINKS.
I DON'T TRUST INFORMATION FROM ANYONE WHO CAN'T HANDLE MORE THAN 16 OUNCES OF HIGH FRUCTOSE AMBROSIA.
>> THEY HAVEN'T A PERMANENT DIRECTOR IN SIX YEARS.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD THERE'S NO ATF DIRECTOR.
THERE'S NO DIRECTOR OF ATF IS IT LIKE A MONTESSORI AGENCY WHERE THERE'S NO DIRECTOR BUT AGENTS
WHO JUST ENCOURAGE TO BE CURIOUS?
AND REGULATE WEAPONS AT THEIR OWN PACE?
>> THE CURRENT ACTING DIRECTOR COMMUTES FROM MINNESOTA.
HE IS THE U.S. ATTORNEY FROM MINNESOTA AS WELL AS ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE ATF?
>> Jon: WHAT?
YOU ARE TELLING ME THIS DUDE, THE GUY WHO IS THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF ATF HAS ANOTHER
FULL-TIME JOB THAT REGULATING ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO AND FIREARMS IS HIS SIDE GIG?
[ LAUGHTER ]
JUST MOONLIGHTING, PICKING UP A LITTLE EXTRA DOUGH.
WHY?
THERE'S 7.8% UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE CAN FIND SOMEBODY TO TAKE THAT JOB WHOP DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER JOB.
>> THE SENATE WON'T CONFIRM ANYBODY TO THE FULL-TIME JOB.
>> Jon: IT'S NOT A CABINET LEVEL POSITION.
WHO GIVES A (bleep).
OR A SCOWRT JUSTICE.
WHY IS IT THE SENATE'S BUSINESS TO -- I'M TOLD THE SENATE HAS TO CONFIRM THE ATF DIRECTOR BECAUSE
CONGRESSMAN JAMES SENSOR BRENNER INSERTED THAT PROVISION INTO THE PATRIOT ACT IN 2006.
SORRY I DON'T HAVE FOOTAGE ON THAT.
IT'S DONE ON THE -- I DO HAVE FOOTAGE OF HIM ACCEPTING THE NRA'S COVETED DIRECTOR OF
FREEDOM AWARD.
