[ APPLAUSE ]THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!
>> HEY!>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL.
CONGRATULATIONS.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFULFILM.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: AND SO WELL DONE.
>> I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO.
>> Jon: OH I ABSOLUTELY.
I WAS INCREDIBLY MOVED.
THE LEAD PERFORMANCE, DAVIDOYELOWO?
>> IT'S JUST OYELOWO.>> Jon: OYELOWO
>> O, YELLOW, O.>> Jon: O, YELLOW, O.
>> YEAH. YELLOW WITH TWO Os.
>> Jon: YELLOW WITH TWO Os.
REMARKABLE.
>> HE'S AMAZING. HE'S AMAZING.
WE GOT TO KNOW THE NAME BECAUSETHIS GUY IS GOING PLACES.
WE'VE GOT TO LEARN IT NOW.
>> Jon: HE'S ALREADY GONEPLACES.
>> YEAH HE IS. YES.
>> Jon: IN THIS FILM.
HOW DOES IT FEEL TOPRESENT A STORY LIKE THIS NOW
THAT RACISM IS OVER? IS IT, ISIT --
[ Laughter ]TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT IT AS A
PART OF OUR LEARNED AND SHAREDHISTORY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: THAT WE NO LONGER DEALWITH.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.WELL, IT'S INTERESTING,
BECAUS, YOU KNOW, WEOPENED THE FILM WITH KING
ACCEPTING THE NOBEL PRIZE.>> Jon: YES.
>> AT A TIME WHEN HE WAS AT THEHEIGHT OF HIS POWERS.
AND AT THAT TIME IF YOU READ,YOU KNOW, A COMMENTARY AND
COLUMNISTS AT THAT TIME WERETALKING ABOUT HOW WE HAD
GOTTEN PAST RACISM BECAUSE HEHAD GOTTEN THE NOBEL PRIZE.
>> Jon: YES.
>> I MEAN, THIS IS THE, THISPOST-RACIAL THING, IS NOT NEW.
>> Jon: YEAH.
>> THE IDEA THAT THAT ONEACHIEVEMENT, YOU KNOW, JUST KIND
OF CLEANS THE SLATE FOREVERYTHING ELSE.
SO, IT'S INTERESTING. AND THESEEVENTS TOOK PLACE 50 YEARS AGO.
>> Jon: I THOUGHT IT WAS VERYINTERESTING THE WAY THAT YOU
PORTRAYED HIS PRAGMATISM.
BECAUSE IT HUMANIZES HIM TO ALARGE EXTENT IN THAT HE CHOSE
CERTAIN MOMENTS FOR THEIRCINEMATIC QUALITY AT TIMES.
HE HAD TO BE CAREFUL ANDCAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT MOMENTS
COULD REPRESENT HIS HIGHESTASPIRATION, AND YOU SHOW HIM
SUFFERING AS HE WATCHESINDIVIDUALS BEING PUNISHED FOR
THAT CHOICE.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, DURING THESELMA MARCHES WERE REALLY
THE FIRST TIME THAT PEOPLE DIEDUNDER KING'S WATCH.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVETHREE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR
LIVES DURING THE SELMACAMPAIGNS, AND SO THAT WAS A
GREAT WEIGHT UPON HIM, A GREATGUILT THAT HE WAS CARRYING.
YOU KNOW, NONVIOLENT THEORY,RESULTING IN VIOLENT DEATH.
AND SO, THAT'S WHY THIS,THIS, THIS TIME IN HIS HISTORY
IS JUST SO RIPE, SO ROBUST FOREXPLORATION.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, THE BIGCONTROVERSY IS THAT LYNDON
BAINES JOHNSON IS NOT ENOUGHOF A HERO IN THIS.
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU, BECAUSE INTHE FILM, I MEAN, TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU, WHEN I READ THECONTROVERSY I EXPECTED THE FILM,
FOR HIM TO BE A VILLAINOUS.
HE IS IN NO WAY THAT.
HE'S A POLITICIAN.
>> YEAH I KNOW.
>> Jon: I'M A LITTLE BAFFLEDNOW.
>> I'M DOING THE SAMETHING AS YOU ARE.
I MEAN, LITERALLY PEOPLE CHEERIN THE THEATER FOR LBJ AT THE
END OF IT.
I MEAN, I'M A LITTLE BAFFLED ASTO WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE.
BUT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TOTHEIR OPINION.
I MEAN, THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WEDON'T PAINT ANYONE AS A SAINT IN
THIS, WE DON'T PAINT ANYONE AS ASINNER.
>> Jon: TELL ME ABOUT YOURESTEEM FOR DR. KING AFTER GOING
THROUGH THIS PROCESS. DOES ITENHANCE IT IN ANY WAY?
WERE THERE SOBERING MOMENTS TOIT?
ULTIMATELY WHAT'S YOUR FEELINGTHROUGH THAT?
>> I THINK, YOU KNOW, MY FEELINGBEFORE WAS THAT I THOUGHT I KNEW
HIM AND I WAS COMFORTABLEWITH WHAT THAT WAS.
IT VERY COMPARTMENTALIZED. ABRAVE MAN, A COURAGEOUS MAN,
BUT NOT REALLY A MAN,YOU KNOW, REALLY AN IDEA.
YOU KNOW, HE BELIEVED INNONVIOLENCE, HE HAD A DREAM,
HE BELIEVED IN PEACE, HE DIED.THOSE ARE THE BROAD STROKES
OF WHAT I THINK PEOPLEUNDERSTAND ABOUT HIM.
AND HE WAS A RADICAL, HE WAS ACHARISMATIC, HE WAS DYNAMIC, HE
WAS A STRATEGIST, HE WAS ATACTICIAN, HE WAS A PRANKSTER,
HE WAS GUILTY, HE HAD EGO, HEWAS LIKE ME, HE WAS LIKE YOU.
AND I GAINED SO MUCH -- YOUDON'T HAVE EGO?
>> Jon: NO, I JUST, LIKE WHENYOU SAID LIKE MARTIN
LUTHER KING, HE WAS LIKE YOU,NO. YOU'RE LIKE NO, I DON'T,
I DON'T --
>> BUT NO, I MEAN, I WOULD ARGUE--
>> Jon: I'LL SAY LIKE, I'LL GIVEYOU PRANKSTER.
>> I WOULD ARGUE THAT HE IS.
BECAUSE HE WAS JUST A BROTHERFROM ATLANTA WHO GOT SWEPT UP
IN HISTORY.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND WAS ABLE TOSTEP IN TO THAT GREATNESS,
BUT TRULY HE WAS A HUMAN BEING,AND THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO PAINT.
>> Jon: I THINK THAT'S SOINTERESTING TOO WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN IT STARTSOUT WHERE
HE'S STEPPING ON TO THE STAGEWITH THE NOBEL CEREMONY AND HE'S
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE TRAPPINGSOF THIS NEW FOUND AND WORRIED
HOW IT WILL MAKE HIM APPEAR.
AND YOU NEVER SORT OF THINK OFTHAT ASPECT OF HIM IN THE THIRD
PERSON GOING, HEY, I REPRESENTTHIS, I CAN NO LONGER BE THIS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: IT'S AS THOUGH HE CAMETO SEE HIMSELF AS A MYTHOLOGICAL
FIGURE AS WELL.
>> RIGHT, WELL HE KNEW WHAT HEMEANT TO PEOPLE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> ON BOTH SIDES OF IT. YOUKNOW, FOR, FOR, FOR FOLKS
THAT WERE NOT, YOU KNOW, STEEPEDIN THE CULTURE OF PEOPLE OF
COLOR, HE WAS, IT WAS A SAFETYTO HIM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SOME OF THEM SAW HIM ASSAFE.
SOME OF THEM SAW HIM ASDANGEROUS, BUT NOT AS DANGEROUS
AS MALCOLM X.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU KNOW. SO, HE WAS THESAFER --
>> Jon: VERY INTERESTING HOWTHAT IS PORTRAYED WITH LYNDON
BAINES JOHNSON.
>> THAT'S IN THE FILM AS WELL.THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Jon: WHO'S SAYING, YOU KNOW,IF WE DON'T LET DR. KING WORK,
MALCOM X -->> THEN WHAT'S OUR OPTION.
>> Jon: RIGHT. >> THERE'RE SOME INTERESTING
IDEAS IN THERE, AND I WOULD JUSTINVITE PEOPLE NOT TO DISMISS IT
BASED ON THE CHALLENGES THATA FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO
BE THE CUSTODIANS OF ONE MAN ARERILING UP. I THINK THERE'S,
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF --
>> Jon: I HOPE THEY DON'T. IT ISMOVING AND COMPLEX AND
THE NARRATIVE -- THE LYNDON B.JOHNSON IS THE LEAST
INTERESTING. IT'S THE PEOPLETHAT DID THAT MARCH IN SELMA.
IT'S ABOUT THEIR COURAGE ANDSTRUGGLE, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
>> OH I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO.
>> Jon: AND I CONGRATULATE YOUTO THE HIGH HEAVENS FOR IT.
>> OH THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOMUCH.
>> Jon: REALLY LOVELY WORK.
>> THANK YOU. GOOD TO BE HERE.
>> "SELMA" IS IN THEATERSEVERYWHERE ON FRIDAY.
AVA DUVERNAY.
