>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW", EVERYBODY.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
BIG GUEST TONIGHT.
THE LOVELY AND TALENTED JENNIFER
ANISTON IS GOING TO BE HERE TO
PROMOTE HER MOVIE "THE SWITCH."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
YOU WILL RECALL MONTHS AGO A NEW
YORK COMMUNITY BOARD APPROVED
PLANS FOR PARK 51, A MUSLIM
COMMUNITY CENTER IN LOWER
PHA *PBTD.
IT WAS ENDORSED AND GOT THE
APPROVAL OF A --
>> I CAN'T FIND PEOPLE WITH A
PROBLEM IT.
BLOOMBERG  IS FOR IT.
I LIKE WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO
DO.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
>> Jon: OH, FOX NEWS.
THAT WAS DECEMBER, WHETHER IT
WAS THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT OR
SEASONAL EFFECTIVE DISORDER NO
ONE WAS WORKED UP BUT THE
DISCUSSION BECAME NOT ABOUT
THEIR RIGHT TO BUILD A PLACE OF
WORSHIP BUT ABOUT WHERE TO BUILD
IT.
I'M IN FAVOR OF FREEDOM OF
RELIGION AND SPEECH BUT YOU HAVE
TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE VICTIMS.
>> THIS IS ABOUT SENSITIVITY.
IF THEY SAID WE WANT A COMMUNITY
CENTER NEAR CENTRAL PARK.
>> Jon: ALL OVER CENTRAL PARK.
WE LOVE MOSQUES.
WE'RE MOSQUE-ATEERS, IF YOU WILL
WE BARBECUE ON WEEKENDS USING
MOSQUE-ITE.
WE LOVE IT.
IT'S AN ARGUMENT ABOUT BEING
SENSITIVE TO THE LOCATION
MEANING --
[LAUGHTER]
YOU ENJOY THAT?
[LAUGHTER]
I FORGET THESE POP UP
OCCASIONALLY.
[LAUGHTER]
IT'S AN ARGUE ABOUT BEING
SENSITIVE TO THE LOCATIONS
MEANING FOR SO MANY WHO LOST SO
MUCH THERE.
IT'S A FAIR QUESTION FOR THE
MOSQUE'S OPPONENTS TO RAISE.
BUT THAT ARGUMENT TOOK A SUBTLE
TURN.
SEE IF YOU CAN CATCH IT.
>> THE ISSUE HERE IS NOT
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND IT'S NOT
PEOPLE WORSHIPING GOD THROUGH
THE ISLAMIC RELIGION.
THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT.
>> ISLAM IS A LIE.
>> WOMEN ARE STONED TO DEATH.
>> IT MUST BE CONVERTED --
>> HE SUPPORTS SHARIA, REFUSES
TO CONDEMN HAMAS.
>> THE MONEY MAY BE SUPPORTING
SAUDI ARABIA.
>> WE'RE STEAK A COMMAND CENTER
FOR TERRORISM AT THE 9/11 SITE.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: I'M FOR FREEDOM OF
RELIGION.
I'M JUST SAYING THIS RELIGION IS
DOMINATED BY WOMEN STONING
SUICIDE BOMBERS.
THAT'S ALL.
THOSE CLIPS WERE JUST FROM THE
PAST 24 HOURS.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
[LAUGHTER]
JUST FOR THE RECORD I'M AGAINST
STEAK A TERRORIST COMMAND POST
AT 9/11 OR REALLY ANYWHERE IN
THE CITY.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
HERE IS THE PART -- LET ME JUST
EXPLAIN THIS.
[LAUGHTER]
HERE IS THE PART OF THE ARGUMENT
I GET.
>> I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE WORLD
TRADE CENTER ON 9/11 WHEN IT
WATCHED THE SECOND PLANE FLY
INTO THE BUILDING.
I WAS THERE.
I HAD A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX IN A
CHASE BANK UNDERNEATH.
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS THE ACTUAL BOX.
THEY FOUND IT TWO YEARS LATER.
>> WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN THERE?
>> I'LL SHOW YOU.
THESE ARE DOLLAR BILLS.
CHARRED.
THOSE ARE TWO COINS MELTED
TOGETHER.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I HAVE
PASSION FOR THIS THING?
THIS IS WHY.
>> Jon: I GET IT.
YOU FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THE
EVENT IN THAT AREA.
YOU LOST FRIENDS AND A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF CASH AND COINS.
[LAUGHTER]
EVEN THOUGH MANY INNOCENT
MUSLIMS ALSO DIED IN THE TOWERS
AND THE PENTAGON AND THE
PENTAGON HAS A MOSQUE IN IT WITH
NO PROBLEMS YOU FEEL THERE
SHOULD NOT BE A MOSQUE IN THERE.
AT LEAST SYMBOLICALLY IT DOES
NOT SIT WELL YOU.
I CAN RESPECT THAT ARGUMENT.
HERE IS WHERE YOU LOSE ME.
>> WE'RE FOLLOWING THE MONEY
TRAIL.
WHERE IS THIS MONEY COMING FROM?
IMAM RAUF IS POUR RAID AS A
MODERATE MUSLIM.
HE HAS QUESTIONABLE TIES.
THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER
HE HAS TIES TO THE GROUP THAT
SENT THE FLOTILLA TOWARDS
ISRAEL -- REMEMBER THAT CONFLICT
ON THE WATER?
HE MAY HAVE TIES, THEY ARE A
HANDSHAKE APART.
>> WHERE IS IRAN IN THIS?
PERDONA, IRAN HAVE BEEN LOOSELY
TIED TO IMAM RAUF ALSO.
DO I WANT A MOSQUE THAT MAY BE A
MEETING PLACE FOR SOME OF THE
SCARIEST MINDS.
>> THE NEXT HAMBURG CELL COULD
BE RIGHT DOWNTOWN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: OR UPTOWN OR MIDTOWN.
DEFINITELY NOT THE VILLAGE, I
MEAN THE RENTS THERE.
[LAUGHTER]
THE VERY FACT THAT THE TRADE
CENTER BOMBING COULD HAVE BEEN
HATCHED FROM HAMBURG MEANS THEY
DON'T HAVE TO BE NEXT TO IT WHEN
THEY PLAN AND MAY HAVE TIES TO
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BAD IDEAS
WHO MAY END UP GETTING MONEY
FROM RELATIVES OF PEOPLE WHO
MIGHT HAVE FOR SOMEONE REASON
SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES FILLED WITH
MONEY.
IT'S A DANGEROUS GAME OF GUILT
BY ASSOCIATION.
COULD YOU PLAY WELL ALMOST
ANYBODY.
ALL YOU NEED IS A CARD AND A
HIGHLIGHTER.
SIT'S NOTHING.
IT'S -- WHAT IS THAT GAME
CALLED?
IT'S --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
IT'S SIX DEGREES OF PEOPLE WHO
DON'T EAT BACON.
[LAUGHTER]
LET ME DO IT FOR YOU.
OKAY, OKAY, HERE LET'S TRY.
THIS HERE IS RUPERT MURDOCH HE
OWNS FOX NEWS.
HE DEFINITELY HAS TIES TO THIS
PRINCE.
HE OWNS THE SECOND LARGEST SHARE
OF NEWS CORP OUTSIDE OF MURDOCH
FAMILY.
HE OWNS 7%.
$2.5 BILLION.
THEY SAY HE IS A LIBERAL MUSLIM
BUT HE IS IN THE SAUDI ROYAL
FAMILY WHICH MAY HAVE TIES TO
FUNDING THE WAHABUS MOSQUES, THE
SAME BRAND OF ISLAM PRACTICED BY
SOME OF THE TERRORISTS.
HE MAY HAVE BUSINESS DEALINGS
WITH THE CARLISLE GROUP WHOSE
CLIENTS INCLUDE THE BIN LADEN
FAMILY ONE OFSS WHO SONS, I'M NOT
GOING TO SAY WHICH SON, ONE MAY
BE ANTI-AMERICAN.
I'M JUST CONNECTING THIS.
I'M JUST READING OFF A
HIGHLIGHTED CARD.
BY THE WAY, AFTER 9/11 -- AFTER
9/11 MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI WOULD
NOT -- AFTER 9/11 RUDY GIULIANI
WOULD NOT ACCEPT $10 MILLION
FROM THE SAME PRINCE BECAUSE HE
CITED MIDEAST POLICY AS ONE OF
REASONS WHY WE WERE ATTACKED
WHICH IS THE SAME REASON THEY
SAID THE IMAM AT THE GROUND ZERO
MOSQUE WAS A RADICAL.
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CARD AND
HIGHLIGHT IT IN YELLOW THE ONLY
THING YOU CAN COME UP WITH IS:
IS FOX NEWS A TERRORIST COMMAND
CENTER?
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST DON'T FOR EXAMPLE I'M
JUST SAYING YOU CAN DRAW THIS UP
SO CLEARLY I'M BEING VERY FAIR.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS WHOLE THING HAS GOTTEN
CRAZY.
IN OUR PANIC WE'VE LOT SIGHT OF
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.
IF ONLY SOMEONE COULD STEP UP
AND CUT THROUGH THE POLITICAL
POSTURING AND FEAR-MONGERING AND
REMIND US WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT.
>> TRAGEDY HAS BEEN AND WILL
ALWAYS BE WITH US.
SOMEWHERE RIGHT NOW EVIL PEOPLE
ARE PLANNING EVIL THINGS.
ALL OF US WILL DO EVERYTHING
MEANINGFUL, EVERYTHING WE CAN DO
TO PREVENT IT.
EACH HORRIBLE ACT CAN'T BECOME
AN ACT FOR OPPORTUNISTS TO
CLEAVE THE BILL OF RIGHTS THAT
PWEUPBDS US -- BINDS US.
>> Jon: THANK YOU CHARLTON
HESTON.
OF COURSE, HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT
OVER ANOTHER TRAGEDY WHEN PEOPLE
ON THE LEFT DEMANDED THAT THE
NRA OUT OF THE RESPECT FOR THE
PEOPLE OF COLUMBINE NOT HOLD
THEIR CONVENTION IN DENVER NEAR
THE SITE OF THE TRAGEDY.
I'M SURE I WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE, PAINTING TOO
NARROW A PICTURE, CONNECTING THE
ACTIONS OF PSYCHOTICS TO THE
GROUP OF PEOPLE EXPRESSING THEIR
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.
I WAS ANGRY AND VERY THIN.
[LAUGHTER]
AND MY HAIR WAS DARK AND I COULD
NOT APPARENTLY BUY A SUIT THAT
FIT.
I DID HAVE TO WEAR KILO BORNE'S
SUITS?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I WAS WRONG AND HESTON WAS RIGHT
AND IF YOU REPLACE NRA WITH
MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND SECOND
AMENDMENT WITH FIRST AMENDMENT,
HE IS STILL RIGHT.
>> AMERICA MUST STOP IF -- ITS
PREDICABLE PATTERN OF REACTION
WHEN AN ISOLATED TERRIBLE EVENT
OCCURS, OUR PHONES RING
DEMANDING THAT THE NRA EXPLAIN
THE INEXPLICABLE.
WHY US?
THE STORY NEEDS A VILLAGE.
THAT IS NOT OUR ROLE IN AMERICAN
SOCIETY AND WE WILL NOT BE
FORCED TO PLAY IT.
IF YOU DISAGREE, THAT'S YOUR
RIGHT.
I RESPECT THAT BUT WE WILL NOT
RELINQUISH IT OR BE SILENCED
ABOUT IT OR BE TOLD, DO NOT COME
HERE, YOU ARE UNWELCOME IN YOUR
OWN LAND.
>> Jon: WELL, SAID, SIR,
