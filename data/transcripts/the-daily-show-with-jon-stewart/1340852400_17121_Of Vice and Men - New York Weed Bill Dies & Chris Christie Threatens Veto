( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon:ING TWO "DAILY SHOW." MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, VERY EXCITING, ANDREW GARFIELD,
20th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
AND HE LOOKS AMAZING.
LISTEN, IF YOU WATCHED THE SHOW FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED A BIT ABOUT
GOVERNOR CUOMO IN NEW YORK HIS PLANS TO DECRIMINALIZE SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIJUANA.
YOU WOULD BE PERMITTED TO CARRY UP TO 25 GRAMS FOR PERSONAL USE WITHOUT GETTING ARRESTED.
TO REMIND YOU, 25 GRAMS IS IS-- IT'S SNUFF TO FILL THIS.
IT'S ENOUGH TO FILL THIS-- I THINK WE MUST HAVE MICE HERE BECAUSE IT WAS UP TO HERE, AND
THERE WERE, LIKE, FIVE BAGS OF DORITOS AROUND HERE.
( LAUGHTER ).
AND THEY'RE ALL-- THAT'S FINE.
NEVER MIND, JUST TO SHOW YOU.
LET ME JUST GET THAT.
SO IT'S-- BY THE WAY, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL, THIS IS LABELED SO THAT I KNOW.
( LAUGHTER ).
ANYWAY, SO I JUST WANT TO REFILL IT UP TO SHOW YOU WHAT WOULD BE LEGAL, YOU KNOW.
>> GOVERNOR CUOMO TODAY CONFIRMING HIS PROPOSAL TO DECRIMINALIZE SMALL AMOUNTOF
MARIJUANA IS DEAD.
SO IT WENT UP IN SMOKE FOLLOWING OPPOSITION IN THE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED STATE SENATE.
>> OOOOH!
>> Jon:  WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME JUST ONE SECOND?
( LAUGHTER ) ( TOILET FLUSHING ) PROBABLY WONDERING WHY I HAVE I TOILET UNDER THERE.
( LAUGHTER ).
SEEING AS THE SHOW IS 22 MINUTES LONG.
( LAUGHTER ).
HEY, MAN, I'M NOT SUPERMAN.
LOOK, HERE'S THE CRAZY PART-- THIS BILL IS DEAD IN NEW YORK,
BUT IN NEW JERSEY, THE STATE ASSEMBLY VOTED MONDAY TO DECRIMINALIZE 15 GRAMS OF POT,
BUT THEIR GOVERNOR DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT.
>> GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE SAYS HE'S GOING TO VETO IT.
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING HE IS IN SUPPORT OF.
>> Jon:  YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, PEOPLE?
WE'RE A GOV-SWAP AWAY FROM MAKING THE GARDEN STATE THE ( BLEEP ) LOOK AT THAT GARDEN STATE!
( LAUGHTER ) I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE TOO HARD TO GET EITHER ONE OF THESE
GUYS TO TOUCH A SKULL, GET DRUNK, AND PEE INTO A FOUNTAIN AND DO THE WHOLE SWITCH.
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH VETOING IT,
CHRIS CHRISTIE?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE COOL, MAN.
>> THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,
WHETHER YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE,
STILL SAYS MARIJUANA IS AN ILLEGAL DRUG.
I DON'T THINK THE STATE SHOULD BE IN THE BUSINESS OF UNDERCUTTING THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT ON THAT POLICY.
>> Jon:  AS MUCH AS I DISAGREE, I DON'T THINK MARIJUANA SHOULD BE ILLEGAL, BUT
IT IS ILLEGAL ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL.
GOVERNOR CHRISTIE IS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, A MAN OF CONVICTION.
>> HE INTEND TO GO FORWARD.
IF SOMEONE WANTS TO STOP US,
THEY'LL HAVE TO TAKE ACTION TO TRY TO STOP US.
>> Jon:  WHAT THE ( BLEEP )!
WAIT!
HOW DID GOVERNOR-- GUYS STOP SMOKING POT, IT'S AGAINST THE LAW-- GO DIRTY HARRY ON IGNORING
THE FEDERAL BAN ON SPORTS GAMBLING.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO?
>> I DON'T THINK ANY OF US ARE OF THE ILLUSION THAT BETTING ON
NFL GAMES ISN'T HAPPENING EVERY WEEK IN NEW JERSEY.
( LAUGHTER ).
>> Jon:  OKAY.
I HAVE AN IDEA.
LET'S REPLACE THE PHRASE "BETTING ON NFL GAMES" WITH THE
PHRASE "GETTING HIGH." ( LAUGHTER ) DIFFERENT HOW?
>> THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT FEELING 30 OR 40 YEARS AGO, BUT THE FACT IS NOW GAMING
IS EVERYWHERE.
>> Jon:  LET'S REPLACE THE WORD "GAMING" WITH THE PHRASE
"GETTING HIGH." ( LAUGHTER ) STILL NOT SEEING WHY CHALLENGING FEDERAL LAW FOR GAMBLING IS
OKAY, CHALLENGING IT FOR POT IS NOT OKAY.
>> LET'S HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT FROM IT BE THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, NOT
CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS NEW JERSEY, WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM IT NOW.
>> Jon:  OKAY, WELL LET'S REPLACE-- ( LAUGHTER ) ACTUALLY, YOU DON'T NEED TO
REPLACE ANY WORDS IN THAT.
( LAUGHTER ) FOR IT TO BE A JUSTIFICATION TO DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA.
I KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS.
GOVERNOR.
SPORTS BETTING AND WEED ARE NOT AS DIFFERENT AS YOU MIGHT THINK.
CLEARLY, GAMING IS YOUR THING.
THAT'S COOL.
HERE'S WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST THINK OF USING MARIJUANA AS BETTING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
