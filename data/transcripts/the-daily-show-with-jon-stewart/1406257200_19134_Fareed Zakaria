I MEAN, WHEN WE CHARGE THEIRCREDIT CARDS, I HAVE A FEELING
WE'LL BE DISAPPOINTED.
>> BUT I THINK, I, I HOPE THATYOU, THAT YOU END UP GETTING

NO, IT'S TRUE...
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: I WOULD LOVE NOTHING
MORE THAN THAT.
>> I THINK YOU'D LOVE IT. IMEAN, BECAUSE
YOU DO AN AMAZINGJOB. YOU PROGRAM HALF AN HOUR.
>> Jon: 22 MINUTES.>> 22 MINUTES.
>> Jon: 22 MINUTES, BUT I DO ITFOUR DAYS A WEEK.
>> I'LL GIVE YOU, I'LL GIVE YOU,I'LL GIVE YOU THE OTHER EIGHT
MINUTES.
>> Jon: AND IT'S KILLING ME.
>> SO THAT'S TWO HOURS OFPROGRAMMING A WEEK.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> RIGHT? CNN HAS 24 HOURS TIMESSEVEN...
>> Jon: SURE.>> 168 HOURS.
>> Jon: YEAH, BUT I'LL DO WHATCNN DOES.
I'LL JUST LET WOLF BLITZER FILLIN THE REST OF THE 18 HOURS.
[LAUGHTER]I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT...
YOU HAVE WRITTEN RECENTLY, THISIS NOT THE WORST TIME IN
HISTORY.
EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
[LAUGHTER]>> WELL, YOU KNOW, JON, IT
WAS RIFFING OFF ASPEECH JOHN McCAIN MADE, ONE OF
YOUR FAVORITES.
>> Jon: WHO?
[LAUGHTER]>> AND HE SAID THAT THIS IS THE
MOST TERRIBLE, YOU KNOW,INTERNATIONAL SECURITY SITUATION
I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFETIME,AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA. AND IJUST THOUGHT WE NEEDED
SOME PERSPECTIVE THAT, YOU KNOW,DURING THE COLD WAR, THE
SUPERPOWERS HAD 45,000 NUCLEARMISSILES POINTED AT EACH OTHER.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WE WENT, WE WENT TO WAR INVIETNAM WHERE
WE LOST 50, WHATEVER IT WAS,ALMOST 60,000 AMERICANS, BUT THE
VIETNAMESE LOST THREE MILLION BYSOME COUNTS, AT LEAST ONE
MILLION.
THERE WAS THE 1973 WAR BETWEENEGYPT AND ISRAEL.
WE WENT UP TO DEFCON THREE,WHICH WAS, YOU KNOW, THE HIGHEST
STATE OF ALERT OTHER THANTHE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS.
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME PRETTYTOUGH STUFF. YES...
>> Jon: WE FOUGHT A CIVIL WAR,WE, WE, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE.
>> YOU MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN,THAT WASN'T DURING McCAIN'S
LIFETIME. IT DOES SEEM, IT DOESSEEM THAT WAY.
[LAUGHTER][CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
THOUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND THEMISTAKE.
>> Jon: HE'S GOING TO LOVETHAT.
>> SO, SO THE POINT I WASMAKING WAS WE'RE FACING SERIOUS,
COMPLICATED ISSUES.THE RUSSIA DOING WHAT IT'S DOING
IN CRI -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, THE RUSSIANSINVADED CZECHOSLOVAKIA IN '68,
AND HUNGARY IN '56.THERE WERE TWO RUSSIAN ATTEMPTS
TO SQUASH, YOU KNOW, THEIRSATELLITES.
WE'RE GOING THROUGH TOUGH STUFF,BUT LET'S NOT START TALKING
ABOUT HOW, OH MY GOD, YOUKNOW, THE WORLD IS
COLLAPSING, WE'VE NEVER SEENANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.
AND THAT DID SEEM VERY PARTISANRATHER THAN SOME KIND OF AN
OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THESITUATION.
>> Jon: FROM McCAIN.>> WELL...
>> Jon: UNUSUAL FOR HIM.
>> WELL, AS YOU KNOW, HE USED TOBE... THERE WAS A TIME WHEN
MCCAIN WAS, WAS DIFFERENT.
>> Jon: YEAH, NO. HE GOT BIT BYA MOSQUITO OR SOMETHING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL, IDON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO THAT GUY, BUTWOULDN'T YOU SAY... IT SEEMS TO
ME THAT A LOT OF THE ISSUE ISINSTABILITY IS MUCH EASIER.
TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE IT SO THATINSTABILITY IS EASIER TO CREATE.
IT TAKES LESS MONEY AND LESSPEOPLE TO CREATE INSTABILITY IN
REGIONS THAN IT USED TO BECAUSETHEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON
RELATIVELY SOPHISTICATEDWEAPONRY FOR VERY SMALL GROUPS.
>> YEAH, THIS IS THE BIG CHANGEIN A SENSE THAT'S TAKEN PLACE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEDEMOCRATIZATION OF VIOLENCE,
YOU KNOW.>> Jon: YES.
>> TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE IT SOTHAT YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THIS PLANE.
IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE EVEN TENYEARS AGO I THINK FOR SMALL
GROUP OF THUGS TO FIRE A MISSILETHAT COULD GO 33,000 FEET UP IN
THE AIR AND TAKE OUT A CIVILIANAIRLINER.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> YOU COULD GET TO LOWER-FLYINGAIRCRAFT.
YOU COULD GET TO HELICOPTERS.
>> Jon: AND THEY HAVE THOSESHOULDER MISSILES.
>> RIGHT. AND THERE WASSHOULDER AND...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT NOW WHAT YOU HAVE IS IT'SESSENTIALLY THE BACK OF A TRUCK.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING WHICH HAS ARADAR THAT IS PRETTY
SOPHISTICATED.
NOW, HERE'S THE CATCH, IT'SSOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO TELL YOU
THAT THERE'S AN AIRLINER ANDYOU CAN HIT IT.
IT CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER IT'SCIVILIAN OR MILITARY.
FOR THAT YOU NEED TO BE PLUGGEDINTO A MUCH WIDER RADAR SYSTEM.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO, IT SHOWS YOU, YOU KNOW,YOU HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO BE
REALLY RESPONSIBLEAND NIHILISTIC. AND THAT'S...
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> THAT'S THE DANGER.
>> Jon: AND, THAT'S THE DANGER.
AND THEN INSTAGRAM IT AS SOON ASYOU DID IT. LIKE THAT'S...
>> RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, THEY'RE DOINGTHIS THING NOW WHERE THEY WEAVE
CHAOS AND THEN POST IT.>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, THAT SEEMS TOBE THEIR METHODOLOGY. AND THEN
THAT CATCHES FIRE AMONGST OTHERDISAFFECTED GROUPS.
SO DOESN'T THAT THROW INTO...
THIS ENTIRE PARADIGM OF AMERICANPOWER THAT SUPPRESSES THESE
POCKETS OF INSTABILITY ISENTIRELY BLOWN OUT OF THE WATER,
THIS IDEA THAT, OH, IF WE JUSTCHANGE REGIMES WE WILL STABILIZE
COUNTRIES.
WHAT WE SEE NOW IS, WE SOWCHAOS.
>> WELL, IT SHOWS YOU THATANYONE TRYING TO DO IT, IT'S
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. LOOK...
>> Jon: RIGHT. BUT NO ONE ELSESEEMS TO TRY TO DO IT.
>> NO, THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ISTRYING IN THEIR OWN WAY...
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> TO SUPPRESS WHAT THEY REGARDAS INSTABILITY, AND EVEN WITH
THE BRUTAL MECHANISM THEY'REUSING, IT'S NOT WORKING.
THE RUSSIANS TRIED IT INCHECHNYA, THEY MANAGED TO DO IT,
KILLED 250,000 CIVILIANS INDOING IT.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> BUT YOU, FUNDAMENTALLY...
>> Jon: WELL, ISRAEL FACESTHE SAME THING.
>> IT DOES. EXACTLY.>> Jon: THEY THINK THAT
OVERWHELMING FORCEWILL BE THE ONLY THING...
>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND THEN THE PEOPLEIN THAT AREA WHO ARE TRAPPED WHO
ARE NOT PART OF HAMAS...>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: OR NOT A PART OF THISINSURRECTION ARE DEVASTATED.
>> RIGHT. THE COST OF DISRUPTIONHAS DROPPED DRAMATICALLY.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AND THE COST OF ESTABLISHING
ORDER OF SOME KIND IS INCREDIBLYHIGH.
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IRAQ, YOUKNOW, WHEN PEOPLE SAY, WELL, IF
WE HAD STAYED THERE, WOULD THATREALLY, WOULD 5,000 AMERICAN
TROOPS MANAGED TO TURN THISAROUND, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY.
>> Jon: RIGHT. 100,000 DIDN'TGET IT TO THE LEVEL OF STABILITY
THAT'S REQUIRED BY SOME OF THESECOUNTRIES.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.
>> Jon: IN YOUR MIND, IS THISNOW THEN THE NEW NORMAL
THAT WE LIVE WITH IS POCKETS OFINSTABILITY THAT CREATE
THESE CONFLAGRATIONS RATHER THANSORT OF WORLD CONFLICTS?
>> WELL, I THINK THE CRUCIALISSUE IS WHERE THE STATE HAS
LOST LEGITIMACY.
AND YOU SEE THAT IN THE BROADERMIDDLE EAST. YOU KNOW,
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE EAST,20 YEARS AGO FROM LIBYA,
TUNISIA, EGYPT, IRAQ, SYRIA, YOUHAD A STABLE ORDER, BUT IT WAS
BASED ON REPRESSION.>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> SO THE LEGITIMACY OF ALLTHOSE REGIMES IS GONE.
AND WHAT IT TURNS OUT IS THEREIS NOTHING HOLDING THOSE
COUNTRIES TOGETHER.
SO PEOPLE ARE PULLING BACK TOTHEIR DEEPER ROOTS, SHIA, SUNNI,
KURD.
>> Jon: DIFFERENT IDENTITIES,TRIBAL AND RELIGIOUS.
>> AND IN THAT SITUATION, ITHINK IT'S VERY HARD TO KEEP THE
STATE TOGETHER. I DON'T THINKIT'S, YOU KNOW, IT'S A PROBLEM
IN PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE ACOHERENT NATIONAL IDENTITY AND
THE STATE IS SEEN ASLEGITIMATE.
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> BUT THERE WILL BE THOSEPOCKETS, AND THOSE I THINK
YOU'LL JUST HAVE A WORLDOF THOSE BADLANDS.
>> Jon: SO, THE NEW STATUS QUOIS WARLORDS AND A MORE FEUDAL
SYSTEM AND A BALKANIZATION...>> RIGHT.
>> Jon: AND THE REST OF US JUSTHAVE TO HOPE
THAT NOBODY THERE GETS A NUKE.
>> AND... RIGHT. AND, DON'T GOTHERE. YOU KNOW,
TRAVEL ADVISORIES ARE GOODFOREIGN POLICY FOR A WHILE.
>> Jon: YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ALWAYSI THINK A RAY OF SUNSHINE AND
OPTIMISTIC VOICE IN AWORLD OF DARKNESS.
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
>> THANK, THANK YOU, BOSS.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: I CAN'T WAIT.
