[LAUGHTER]
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS HE GOT HIS PANETTA TESTIMONY.
SO NOW THE SENATE CAN FINALLY GO FORWARD WITH HAGEL'S CONFIRMATION AND THE C.I.A.
DIRECTORSHIP.
THE GENERAL BUSINESS OF THE SENATE, CUT TO THREE DAYS AFTER PANETTA'S TESTIMONY.
>> I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD ALLOW BRENNAN TO GO FORWARD FOR THE C.I.A. DIRECTORSHIP, HAGEL TO BE
CONFIRMED AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE UNTIL THE WHITE HOUSE GIVES US AN ACCOUNTING.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT OUR PRESIDENT DID.
WHAT DID HE DO AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF?
DID HE CALL ANYBODY?
>> Jon: YOU SAID AFTER PANETTA.
HAGEL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BENGHAZI WHICH IS AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER REASON I'VE HEARD TO
CONFIRM HIM.
GET THE OTHER GUY OUT OF THERE, RIGHT?
MONTHS OF MEDIA INQUIRIES AND ANY NUMBER OF CLASSIFIED BRIEFINGS.
KEEP PURSUING IT.
THAT'S FINE BUT WHY BRING THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS TO A HALT?
YOU KNOW WHO IS NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH THIS YOUR PAL JOHNNY McCAIN BECAUSE HE LIVES BY A
DIFFERENT CODE.
IN A TIME OF TROUBLE AND DANGER FOR OUR COUNTRY, WHO WILL PUT OUR COUNTRY FIRST?
[CROWD RESPONDS JOHN McCAIN]
>> Jon: THEY JUST SHOUTED SOMETHING AT HIM.
THAT'S RIGHT JOHN McCAIN DOESN'T HAVE TIME, GRAHAM, FOR YOUR CHEAP POLITICAL GAMES.
HE WILL GET THIS TRAIN BACK ON TRACK LIKE THE STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS.
>> I DO NOT BELIEVE WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS NOMINATION UNTIL QUESTIONS ARE
ANSWERED THAT SENATOR GRAHAM AND SENATOR AYOTTE AND I HAVE ASKED TO BE ANSWERED.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHAT THE HELL.
SORRY BUT IT'S HARD TO TAKE YOUR TENACITY ON BENGHAZI AS HONEST FACT FINDING GIVEN, MR.
McCAIN, SOME OF YOUR PAST HISTORY ON THE SUBJECT.
>> McCAIN DID NOT APRIL TEND THE CLASSIFIED BRIEFING ON BENGHAZI YESTERDAY.
>> HE WAS HAVING A PRESS CONFERENCE CALLING FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE COMPLAINING
ABOUT NOT GETTING ENOUGH INFORMATION.
>> Jon: MR. McCAIN HERE IS THE INFORMATION YOU REQUESTED.
NOT NOW, CAN'T YOU SEE I'M BUSY DEMANDING THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND AND ARE
ATTEMPTING TO GIVE TO ME.
AND GET OFF MY LAWN YOU SON OF A --
[LAUGHTER]
SENATOR McCAIN WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?
>> WE'VE HAD A MASSIVE COVERUP.
A COVERUP.
>> OF WHAT?
>> OF THE INFORMATION CONCERNING DEATHS OF FOUR BRAVE AMERICANS.
THE INFORMATION HAS NOT BEEN FORTHCOMING.
>> YOU SAID THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION.
>> DO YOU CARE DAVID --
>> I'M ASKING -- I'M ASKING YOU DO YOU CARE WHETHER FOUR AMERICANS DIED?
>> Jon: WHAT, WHOA, WHOA, DO YOU CARE -- WHOA, STOP THIS TRAIN!
WHAT?
I SAY --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
STOPPING THE TRAIN WITH SOME KIND OF DEVICE YOU REALLY DON'T FIND ON TRAINS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO!
McCAIN, YOU CAN TAKE THAT WHEREVER YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO, McCAIN, YOU DON'T GET TO PULL THE FOURTH DEAD AMERICANS -- (bleep), YOU LOST
THAT PRIVILEGE OVER I DON'T KNOW THE IRAQ WAR WHICH I BELIEVE AMERICAN CASUALTYWISE WAS
LITERALLY BENGHAZI TIMES 1,000.
AND FAR FROM HOLDING UP ALL SENATE BUSINESS UNTIL THAT FIASCO WAS RESOLVED I THINK YOU
HAD A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.
>> IS THE SENATE GOING TO HAVE A FULL INVESTIGATION OF WHAT LED UP TO IRAQ?
>> I THINK WE HAVE INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON AND WE HAVE HAD INVESTIGATIONS -- I'M
NOT AGAINST INVESTIGATIONS.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T WASTE A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY.
>> Jon: DON'T YOU CARE?
DON'T YA CARE ABOUT DEAD AMERICANS?
DON'T YA?
LET ME FINISH DON'T YA CARE?
DON'T YA?
WHAT WAS THE MANTRA THEN WAS IT EVERYONE RESPONSIBLE FROM THE IRAQ DEBACLE FROM THE FAULTY
INTELLIGENCE TO 50 TONS OF MUSTARD GAS ON A TURKEY FARM TO COLIN POWELL AND HIS VILE OF
CONFECTIONERS ANTHRAX THAT THEY ALL MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WAS WAS THIS?
>> EVERY INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN THE WORLD BELIEVED SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
THING GOES BAD IN WARS.
MISTAKES HAPPEN.
WHEN THINGS GO BAD, THINGS GO BAD.
THE WAR OF MISMANAGED.
WE ARE WHERE WE ARE NOW.
MISTAKES HAVE BEEN MADE.
THEY'VE BEEN WELL CHRONICLED IN COVERT TO AND FIASCO.
>> Jon: A LOT OF BOOKS FIASCO, (bleep) BRAIN ADVENTURE.
THERE WAS THAT BOOK "BOY WHERE WE WRONG." THERE WAS "FIST SHADES OF WRONG." THAT WAS BOOK "OOPS BASED ON THE
NOVEL WRONG BY SAPPHIRE.
OH, YEAH THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN WHO KNEW YOU WERE WRONG.
I GET IT THINGS GO BAD.
WE ARE WHERE WE ARE.
THE ONLY THING THAT WOL MAKE THIS WORSE WOULD BE IF NOT ONLY WAS McCAIN HYPOCRITICAL ABOUT
HIS LEVEL OF OUTRAGE BUT IF THE LEVEL OF OUTRAGE FUELING THE HAGEL FILIBUSTER WAS WITH A HINT
OF JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL PETTINESS.
>> IT GOES BACK TO THERE'S A HAD THE OF ILL WILL TOWARDS SENATOR HAGEL BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS A
REPUBLICAN HE ATTACKED PRESIDENT BUSH MERCILESSLY AT ONE POINT SAID HE WAS THE WORST PRESIDENT
SINCE HERBERT HOOVER, SAID THAT THE SURGE WAS THE WORST BLUNDER SINCE THE VIETNAM WAR WHICH IS
NONSENSE AND WAS VERY ANTI-HIS OWN PARTY AND PEOPLE.
PEOPLE DON'T FORGET THAT.
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL, BUSH WAS THE WORST PRESIDENT SINCE HERBERT HOOVER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND SECOND -- -- SECOND, YOU (bleep) HATED HIM.
HAAAATED HIM.
HATED.
AND THIRD BLOCKING A SECRETARY OF DEFENSE NOMINEE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR CURRENT
REDISCOVERED MORAL OUTRAGE AT AMERICAN DEATHS OVERSEAS WHILST COPPING TO MAYBE A LITTLE
PAYBACK IS THE ANTITHESIS OF YOUR CAMPAIGN SLOGAN SO PARDON ME, SIR, BUT PERHAPS
