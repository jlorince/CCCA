>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,WELCOME TO THE DAILY SHOW,
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A FINE PROGRAM FORYOU TONIGHT, SENATOR AL
FRANKEN WILL JOIN US IN ALITTLE BIT.
WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
BUT I WANT TO TALK AGAINABOUT OBVIOUSLY THE TRAGEDY THAT
HAPPENED.
THIS WEEK, THE EMERGENCE OFDYLANN ROOF'S WHITE POWER
MANIFESTO AND HATE-STAGRAMPHOTOS DID LITTLE TO ALLEVIATE
ANY CONFUSION ABOUT WHY HE DIDIT.
ABOUT WHY THIS WHITERACIST'S RACIST RACE EVASIONS
FOR ASSASINATING NINECHURCHGOERS WHILE RACISTING
RACE-ORIC.
I GUESS WE'LL JUST NEVERKNOW WHY HE DID IT.
NOW YOU MAY THINK A TRAGEDYSUCH AS THIS WOULD BE AN
OPPORTUNE TIME TO DISCUSSTHE COMPLEX VARIETY OF DEEP
SEEDED, UNEXAMINED ISSUES ANDFAILING THAT PERMEATE AMERICAN
CULTURE LIKE A SUBTERRANEANFAULT LINE THAT MOST ONLY NOTICE
UPON SEISMIC ERUPTIONS, ABOVE ASIX OR SEVEN ON THE RICHTER
SCALE.
IT TURNS OUT, THIS IS NOT A GOODTIME.
>> THE RACE TO POLITICIZETHE SENSELESS SOUTH CAROLINA
CHURCH SHOOTING TRAGEDY.
>> SO THEY COULDN'T WAIT?
>> YOU COULD HAVE WAITED FORSOME OF THIS.
WE HAVEN'T EVEN BURIED OURDEAD YET.
>> BEFORE THE BODIES HAVE EVENBEEN BURIED.
>> THEY TRY AND BLAME GUNSAND DO EVERYTHING BUT IT IS
MISDIRECTED.
>> THE PRESIDENT, HE IS BLAMINGGUNS, LIBERALS POLITICIZEING
THIS.
>> THE PRESIDENT GENERALLYDEALS WITH THIS WHOLE ISSUE
POLITICALLY  RATHER THANSUBSTANTIVELY.
>> THE BODIES AREN'T COLDAND YOU HAVE PEOPLE TRYING
TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS OF IT,AND IT'S FANKLY DISGUSTING.
>> IT'S ALMOST LIKE ASICKNESS LIKE, OH, WAIT. TRAGEDY
HAPPENS.
LET'S SEE HOW WE CAN ADVANCE OURNARRATIVE.
>> Jon: YES, IT'S A SICKNESS,THIS RUSH TO USE TRAGEDY TO
ADVANCE YOUR NARRATIVE.
COMBINE THAT WITH AN INABLILTYFOR SELF-EXAMINATION, AND
ALMOST COMICAL DEGREE OFSELF-EXCULPABLE RHETORIC,
FLAG PINS, A LITTLE BIT OFLEG AND A COMPLETE IMMUNITY
TO IRONY, YOU GOT YOURSELF AFULL BLOWN CASE OF FOXABETES.
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE AMAZMAING.
THEY ARE AMAZING.
THEY ARE AMAZING AT WHATTHEY DO.
REMIND ME THIS PAST DECEMBERWHEN TWO NEW YORK CITY COPS
WERE TRAGICALLY KILLED AT A TIMEWHEN PEOPLE WERE PROTESTING THE
POLICE SHOOTINGS OF UNARMEDBLACK MEN.
TALK TO ME ABOUT THE RESTRAINTFOX USED IN NOT ADVANCING THEIR
NARRATIVE.
>> I PERSONALLY FEEL THATMAYOR DE BLASIO, SHARPTON
AND OTHERS LIKE THEM, THEYACTUALLY HAVE BLOOD ON THEIR
HANDS.
>> THEY NOW HAVE BLOOD ONTHEIR HANDS.
YES, THEY DO.
>> MANY CLAIM NEW YORK CITYMAYOR BILL DE BLASIO HELPED
FAN THE FLAMES OFANTI-POLICE SETTLEMENT.
>> THE VIOLENT POLICERHETORIC THAT HELPED POISON
THE MINDS OF MANY, INCLUDINGTHE DERANGED GUNMAN.
>> DE BLASIO AND I THINK THEPRESIDENT HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY
CREATED RACIAL TENSIONS THATWORSENS THE SITUATION FOR
LAW ENFORCEMENT.
>> LOOK AT THE PRODUCT ANDTHE ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE NOW.
>> YOU HAVE TO PUT THE BLAMEFIRST WITH THE PRESIDENT.
>> THE MAYOR.
HE DID RUN A CAMPAIGNTHAT WAS PRETTY ANTI-COP IN
NEW YORK.
>> Jon: SO YOU NO RESTRAINT.
AND REMEMNER THIS GUY?
RICH "THE BODIES AREN'T COLDYET, IT'S DISGUSTING" LOWRY?
ONLY FOUR DAYS AFTER THEPOLICE DEATHS, HE CAME OUT
WITH AN OP-ED USING THEOFFICER'S DEATHS TO ATTACK BILL
DE BLASIO, ACCUSING THE MAYORAS PEDDLING THE IDEA THAT POLICE
ARE RACISTS.
THAT CAME OUT THREE DAYSBEFORE THE FUNERAL OF THE
FIRST OFFICER, AKA, BARELY MORETHAN THE AM OF TIME BETWEEN
THE CHARLESTON SHOOTING ANDLOWRY'S SENSITIVE ON-AIR
PLEA AGAINST POLITICIZINGTHIS EVENT.
BUT DESPITE PLEASE TO THE DOANYTHING, IT LOOKS LIKE SOME
PEOPLE MIGHT ACTUALLY TRY TODO SOMETHING.
>> IN SOUTH CAROLINA TODAYPROTESTORS DEMANDED THE
CONFEDERATE FLAG BE TAKENDOWN FROM THE STATE CAPITOL.
>> FOR MANY, THE FLAGREPRESENTS HATE AND
INTOLERANCE.
>> MITT ROMNEY TWEETED HISSUPPORT FOR TAKING THAT FLAG
DOWN.
>> JEB BUSH, WHO SAID THAT ITWOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO
TAKE DOWN THE FLAG.
>> TWO-THIRDS OF THE STATELEGISLATURE HAS TO VOTE TO
REMOVE THE FLAG.
>> Jon: TWO-THIRDS,TWO-THIRDS.
THAT MAKES SENSE, YOU DON'T WANTTO IMPULSIVELY TAKE DOWN A
150-YEAR-OLD SYMBOL FOR AN ARMEDINSURRECTION AGAINST THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA, OTHERWISE, IMEAN, IT'S MOB RULE.
THE TRUTH S IT IS THEABSOLUTE LES THAT CAN BE
DONE.
IN CHARLESTON, EMMANUEL AMECHURCH IS ON CALHOUN STREET,
NAMED FOR FORMER VICEPRESIDENT JOHN CALHOUN.
LET'S CALL HIM THE RACISTCHRISTOPHER LLOYD.
HE WAS 19th CENTURYAMERICA'S FOREMOST DEFENDER
OF SLAFERER, THE GUYS WHO SAYSLAVERY WASN'T A NECESSARY EVIL,
BUT A POSITIVE GOOD.
THAT IS THE ADDRESS THATTHIS CHURCH HAS TO HAVE ON
THEIR LETTERHEAD.
TAKE A SHORT WALK DOWN THESTREET, YOU ARE AT THE
DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY'SCONFEDERATE HISTORY MUSEUM,
WHERE REBEL UNIFORMS AREVENERATED LIKE SHAT ROWD OF
TURIN.
I TOUCHED GENERAL LEE'STONIC, IT CURED MY SHINGLES.
YOU CAN'T SPILT YOURTABACCY IN CHARLESTON
WITHOUT HITTING A PUBLICMONDAYMENT TO THE GLORIOUS
DAYS OF SLAVERY, BECAUSE INTHE CONTEXT OF CHARLESTON'S
EXTENSIVE CONFEDERATE PORNINDUSTRY, THE FLAG IS JUST A
MONEY SHOT.
THAT TOWN IS LIKECONFEDERATE EPCOT.
