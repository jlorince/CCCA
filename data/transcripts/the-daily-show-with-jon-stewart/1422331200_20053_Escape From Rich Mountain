THE BACKBONE OF EVERYAMERICAN COMMUNITY.

THE 47 PERCENT.

PRESIDENT WHO DIDN'T LIKETHEM BUT IT'S GREAT TO SEE
REPUBLICANS DISTANCETHEMSELVES FROM THEIR OLD

FROM THE MOOCHER CLASS, THESOLUTION IS DEREGULATION AND
REPEAL OG BAMA HEALTH PLAN.
IN 2016 IF YOU WANT TOEMPOWER THE MOOCHER CLASS,
THE SOLUTION IS APPARENTLYDEREGULATING AND REPEALING

PENICILLIN NEVER CLEAREDYOUR CHLAMYDIA AND JUST MADE
YOUR DOCTOR REALLY RICH.
