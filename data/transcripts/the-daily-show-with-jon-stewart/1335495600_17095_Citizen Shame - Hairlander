HE'S DEFLECTING WITH VIN THE CHIN-TYPE.
CONTRAST THAT WITH DONALD TRUMP.
AS IT HAPPENS THE DONALD WAS ALSO TESTIFYING IN THE U.K. THIS WEEK.
HERE'S HIS TESTIMONY BEFORE THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT OF A WIND TURBINE BEING BUILT OFF THE
COAST OF A GOAL RESORT HE BOUGHT.
>> THE GOLF RESORT ONLY WENT AHEAD BECAUSE HE WAS ASSURED THERE WOULD BE NO NEARBY WIND
DEVELOPMENT, AND HE CLAIMED ALEX SOON HAD GIVEN HIM SIMILAR,
PRIVATE ASSURANCES.
>> ALEX SALMON TOLD ME-- HE SCOFFED AT THE IDEA AT A DINNER WE ARE IN NEW YORK.
WE WERE IN NEW YORK AT A DINNER.
( LAUGHTER )
>> Jon:  YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE?
HERE'S MURDOCH.
HEY, MATE, I DID HAVE A DINNER,
BUT YEAH, MAYBE THEY WERE THERE.
I DON'T REMEMBER.
AND HERE'S TRUMP.
WE COLLUDED ON THIS!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) COME ON!
YOU PROMISED ME!
BY THE WAY, DONALD, WHY DIDN'T YOU WANT THE WIND TURBINES?
>> THEY'RE UGLY.
THEY ARE IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND AND COAST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
AND IF THEY ALLOW THIS MADNESS TO CONTINUE, THEY WILL DESTROY SCOTLAND.
>> THESE COMPUTER-GENERATED IMAGES ARE FROM THE COMPANY MONDAY THE PROPOSED WIND FARM.
THEY'RE 200 METERS TALL AND DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THEM.
>> Jon:  YES.
NO, I CAN SEE HOW THAT WOULD RUIN THE VIEW OF THE SCOTTISH COASTLINE.
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, I WONDER WHAT TRUMP HAS BEEN BUILDING OVER THERE.
I WONDER WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE-- OH, GOOD GOD!
( APPLAUSE ) RUN FOR PRESIDENT!
