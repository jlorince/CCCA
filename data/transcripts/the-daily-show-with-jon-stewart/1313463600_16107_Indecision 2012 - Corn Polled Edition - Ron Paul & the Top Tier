VASECTOMYED FIRST?
SO NOW WITH PAWLENTY DROPPING
OUT, RICK PERRY DROPPING IN,
WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A RACE.
>> WE HAVE A TOP TIER.
IT IS MITT ROMNEY, RICK PERRY
AND MICHELE BACHMANN.
>> WE HAVE A NEW TOP TIER.
PERRY, ROMNEY AND BACHMANN.
>> THERE'S A TOP TIER IN THIS
RACE OF ROMNEY, PERRY AND
BACHMANN.
>> THAT'S FAIR SO SAY.
>> Jon: REALLY, FAIR TO SAY?
YOU'RE NOT FORGETTING ANYONE
SAY AN IDEOLOGICALLY
CONSISTENT CONGRESSMAN WHO
CAME WITHIN 200 VOTES OF
WINNING THE STRAW POLL.
ISN'T ANYONE GOING TO GIVE
THAT GENTLEMAN A LITTLE LOVE.
>> THERE'S A TOP TIER OF
BACHMANN, PERRY AND ROMNEY AND
WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED, WE
SHOULD.
>> Bob: THANK YOU.
>> WE HAVEN'T MENTIONED WE
SHOULD RICK SANTORUM WHO DID
SURPRISINGLY WELL FOR THE
AMOUNT OF MONEY AND RESOURCES
HE HAD.
>> Jon: RICK SANTORUM.
HE DIDN'T GET HALF OF WHAT RON
PAUL GOT.
HE LOST TO THE GUY WHO LOST SO
BAD HE DROPPED OUT OF THE
RACE.
SANTORUM?
>> WE'RE LOOKING AT MITT
ROMNEY WHO CONTINUES TO BE THE
FRONTRUNNER.
BUT WE HAVE RICK PERRY AS WELL
AND NOW MICHELE BACHMANN.
LET'S NOT COUNT OUT JOHN
HUNTSMAN THOUGH.
>> Jon: WHAT?
JOHN HUNTSMAN?
HUNTSMAN GOT 69 VOTES.
IF ALL OF JOHN HUNTSMANS
SPORTERS MET AT THE SAME AMES
IOWA RESTAURANT THE FIRE
MARSHAL WOULD SAY, THAT'S
FINE.
NO PROBLEM.
THERE'S STILL SOME TABLES OPEN
IN THE BACK.
HUNTSMAN WAS THE ONLY MORMON
RUNNING IN THE STRAW POLL, AND
HE CAME IN SECOND AMONGST
MORMONS.
AND BY THE WAY THIS PRETENDING
RON PAUL DOESN'T EXIST FOR
SOME REASON HAS BEEN GOING ON
FOR WEEKS.
>> A NEW GALLUP SURVEY SHOWING
RICK PERRY RUNNING SECOND TO
MITT ROMNEY KNOCKING DOWN IOWA
FAVORITE MICHELE BACHMANN TO
FOURTH.
>> Jon: BEHIND WHO?
FOURTH BEHIND WHO?
HOW DID LIBERTARIAN RON PAUL
BECOME THE 13th FLOOR IN A HOE
HOTEL?
WHY... WHAT'S WRONG WITH... HE
IS TEA PARTY PATIENT ZERO.
ALL THAT SMALL GOVERNMENT
GRASS ROOTS BUSINESSES HE
PLANTED THAT GRASS.
THESE OTHER FOLKS ARE JUST
MORAL MAJORITIES IN A TRY
CORNERED HAT.
RON PAUL IS THE REAL DEAL.
FOX NEWS SHOULD LOVE THIS GUY.
WATCH THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN
THE DEBATE MODERATORS AT FOX'S
THURSDAY'S DEBATE AND THE
DEBATE AUDIENCE.
>> IRAN DOES NOT HAVE AN AIR
FORCE THAT CAN COME HERE.
JUST LIKE WE DID IN IRAQ,
BUILD UP THE WAR PROPAGANDA.
THERE IS NO AL QAEDA IN IRAQ.
THEY HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND
WE HAD TO GO IN.
I'M SURE YOU SUPPORTED THAT
WAR AS WELL.
IT'S TIME WE QUIT THIS.
IT'S TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS
WE'RE SPENDING ON THESE WARS.
>> Jon: WHAT'S WITH THE SMIRK
AND THE EYE ROLL?
THE CROWD GOES NUTS AND YOU DO
ONE OF THESE.
THERE GOES CRAZY UNCLE RON.
BABBLING ABOUT THE
UNSUSTAINABILITY OF MULTIPLE
WARS.
HE'S THE ONE GUY IN THE FIELD
WHO DOESN'T GO OUT OF HIS WAY
TO REGURGITATE TALKING POINTS
OR CHANGE WHAT HE BELIEVES TO
FIT THE AUDIENCE HE'S IN FRONT
OF YOU.
AND YOU'RE TREATING HIM LIKE
IF THIS WERE CELEBRITY
APPRENTICE, HE'D BE THIS GUY.
BY THE WAY, OF THE AMES IOWA
STRAW POLL IT USE TO BE
HUNTSMAN 77-69.
EVEN WHEN THE MEDIA DOES
REMEMBER RON PAUL IT'S ONLY TO
REASSURE THEMSELVES THERE'S NO
NEED TO REMEMBER THERE WAS RON
PAUL.
>> SEVERAL OF THE CANDIDATES
ARE HERE TODAY.
WE HAVE LIVE PICTURES OF RON
PAUL BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
SARAH PALIN AND RICK PERRY,
TWO PEOPLE NOT IN THE RACE YET
TOO.
>> IF YOU GET VIDEO OF IS AOR
A PALIN OR GET A SOUND BITE
FROM HER, BRING THAT BACK TO
US.
YOU CAN HOLD THE RON PAUL
STUFF.
