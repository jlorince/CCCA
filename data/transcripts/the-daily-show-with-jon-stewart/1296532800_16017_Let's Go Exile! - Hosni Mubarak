NOW?
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
HOSNI, YOU'VE BEEN EGYPT'S
DICTATOR FOR 30 YEARS NOW.
NOW THE PEOPLE HAVE ISSUED A,
LET'S SAY, LAST CALL.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO HOME BUT
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.
IN FACT YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
GO TO YOUR HOME.
THEY'RE PROBABLY THINKING OF
LIGHTING IT ON FIRE.
NOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
HOSNI, LET US HELP YOU OUT
WITH OUR NEW SEGMENT.
IT'S TIME.
YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
STAY?
MOVE TO 10:00 HOPING NINE
MONTHS THE SAME PEOPLE WHO
KICKED YOU OUT ASK YOU TO COME
BACK?
EVEN MOBS DON'T MISMANAGE
THINGS THAT BADLY.
SO LET'S LOOK AT YOUR OPTIONS.
WELL, WITH ITS VIBRANT
DICTATOR TOURISM INDUSTRY,
FRANCE HAS ATTRACTED AN
ECLECTIC EX-PAT COMMUNITY FROM
CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC'S
JEAN-BEDEL BOW KAS A, TO
TUNISIA'S RECENTLY OUSTED
PRESIDENT BEN ALI.
THE FRENCH MAY HAVE
GUILLOTINED THEIR OWN TYRANTS
BUT EVERY ELSE IS INVITED TO
HAVE CAKE.
NOW THAT BABY DOC DUVALIER IS
GIVING HAITI A SHOT, PERHAPS
FRANCE IS TOO WESTERN AND TOO
CLOSE TO THE HAGUE FOR YOUR
TASTES.
PERHAPS YOU'D ENJOY ANOTHER
EXILE HOT SPOT, THE ARABIAN
PENINSULA.
WHERE THERE ARE PLENTY OF ARAB
DICTATORS WAITING TO BEFRIEND
YOU.
MOST OF THEM STILL IN POWER.
PLAY HANDBALL IN IDI AMIN'S
PRIVATE COURT.
BASQUE YEAR ROUND IN THE
NATION'S 90 TO 140 DEGREE
TEMPERATURES.
WHO SAYS YOU CAN'T GO HOME
AGAIN OTHER THAN OBVIOUSLY THE
PEOPLE OF EGYPT THAT KICKED
YOU OUT.
HEAD TO DUBAI'S MAN MADE WORLD
ISLAND'S ARCHIPELAGO.
FIND OUT WHO IS REPRESENTING
THE EGYPT-SHAPED ISLAND AND
STAGE YOUR OWN MINI-COUPS.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
COME ON, HOS KNEE.
I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING, I LOVE
THE FRENCH LANGUAGE.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
BUT I ALSO LOVE THE OPPRESSIVE
HEAT OF THE ARABIAN PENINSULA.
WELL WITH A LITTLE SMART
PLANNING, YOU CAN PITCH A TENT
IN SENEGAL WHERE YOU CAN
CELEBRATE RAMADAN WITH CHAD'S
FORMER DICTATOR HISSENE HABRE
WHILE BASQUING IN A POOL OF
YOUR OWN SWEAT.
YES, SENEGAL.
WHERE THE NATIONAL LANGUAGE IS
FRENCH AND THE NATIONAL
DISEASE IS YELLOW FEVER WITH A
TOUCH OF MOSQUITO BORN
LEPROSY.
BUT IF YOU'RE STILL NOT READY
TO RETIRE AT THE VIGOROUS
YOUNG AGE OF 82 AND YOU WANT
TO STAY ACTIVE THERE IS AN
EXCITING CASTING OPPORTUNITY
I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT.
IT'S A CHANCE TO LIVE IN EXILE
AND COMPETE FOR BIG CASH
PRIZES ON NEXT SEASON'S BIG
BROTHER BIG BROTHER EDITION.
WHEN FIVE DEPOSED DICTATORS
AND AMAROSA FIND OUT WHAT
CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE FEELS
LIKE ON THE RECEIVING END.
YOU CAN EVEN SHARE A ROOM WITH
YOUR NEIGHBOR, MOAMMAR
QADDAFI.
OOPS.
HE HASN'T BEEN OVERTHROWN.
YET.
YOU SEE, MR. SOON TO BE
EX-PRESIDENT LOTS OF GOOD
THINGS AWAIT YOU IN THIS NEW
CHAPTER OF YOUR LIFE.
SO PACK YOUR BAGS.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
(BEEP) IT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO
