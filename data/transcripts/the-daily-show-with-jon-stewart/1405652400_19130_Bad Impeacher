[LAUGHTER]BUT FIRST, THE REAL QUESTION IS
THIS: WHAT TIME IS IT?
DID YOU REALLY JUST SHOUT "PARTYTIME"?
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE I'M SETTINGUP A BIT OF A ROUTINE HERE?
[LAUGHTER]JUST GOT OUT OF COLLEGE,
IT'S JUST A REFLEX.

A LITTLE BIT QUIET NOW.
A LITTLE BIT SOFTER NOW.
YOU MAY BE THINKING TO YOURSELF,TIME TO HAVE THE TV ON IN THE
BACKGROUND WHILE I HAVE SEX.
WRONG!

I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO TELL YOUWHAT TIME IT IS.
I'M GOING TO LET MY FRIEND SARAHDO IT FOR ME.
