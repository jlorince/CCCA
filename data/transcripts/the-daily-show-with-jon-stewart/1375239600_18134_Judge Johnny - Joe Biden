JASON, PLEASE CALL OUR FINAL
DEFENDANT.
>> SURE WILL, JUDGE JOHNNY.
THE COURT CALLS JOSEPH R.
BIDEN,, Jr., THE DELAWARE
DESTROYER, HE'S GOT A LION'S
HEART, A SAILOR'S MOUTH AND SOME
OTHER DUDE'S HAIR.
HE LOVES TRAINS BUT HE JUST GOT
ON AN EXPRESS TO JUSTICE TOWN
WHERE THE MAYOR IS JUDGE JOHNNY.
LOOKS LIKE VICE PRESIDENT
BIDEN'S ABOUT TO EAT A JUSTICE
SALAD.
>> OKAY.
THANKS VERY MUCH, JASON.
LET'S HEAR THE CHARGES.
>> IN WASHINGTON STATE ACCUSED
OF ILLEGALLY DISCHARGING HIS
SHOTGUN HE'S USING A NEW LEGAL
TECHNIQUE HENCEFORTH KNOWN AS
THE BIDEN DEFENSE.
>> John: THE BIDEN DEFENSE?
THAT'S ACTUALLY A CHESS MOVE
WHERE IF YOU'RE LOSING YOU JUST
EAT YOUR OPPONENT'S QUEEN.
HOW HAS A GUY WHO FIRED A
SHOTGUN GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE VICE PRESIDENT?
>> HE CLAIMS HE WAS TRYING TO
SCARE OFF WOULD-BE CAR PROWLERS
BUT DEPUTIES SAY HE WENT ABOVE
THE LAW.
>> I DID WHAT JOE BIDEN TOLD ME
TO DO.
I WENT OUTSIDE AND FIRED MY
SHOTGUN IN THE AIR.
>> John: COME ON.
HE DID NOT TELL YOU TO DO THAT.
THERE IS NO WAY THAT BIDEN
LITERALLY TOLD YOU YOU SHOULD GO
AND GET A SHOTGUN AND FIRE TWO
BLASTS OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE.
>> IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT
YOURSELF, GET A DOUBLE-BARREL
SHOTGUN.
IF THERE'S EVER A PROBLEM JUST
WALK OUT ON THE BALCONY HERE,
WALK OUT, PUT THAT DOUBLE-BARREL
SHOTGUN AND FIRE TWO BLASTS
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.
SNOB A LITTLE ADVICE FOR TRICK
OR TREATERSALITY JOE BIDEN'S
HOUSE, IF HE'S NOT OFFERING YOU
A TREAT, RUN.
LOOK, THIS MAN DIDN'T ACTUALLY
SHOOT ANYONE SO WHAT IS THE
PROBLEM.
>> PROSECUTORS AND SHERIFF
DEPUTIES SAY THE WAY THE LAW IS
WRITTEN DOESN'T AFFORD PEOPLE
THE RIGHT TO JUST FIRE OFF THEIR
GUNS.
THERE MUST BE A SELF-DEFENSE
COMPONENT.
>> John: THERE MUST BE A
SELF-DEFENSE COMPONENT.
FOR EXAMPLE, SAY THE PERSON HAD
BEEN WEARING A HOODIE, THEN YOU
WOULD BE FINE.
THIS IS A TOUGH CASE.
ON ONE HAND PEOPLE PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T JUST FIRE SHOTGUN
BLASTS INTO THE AIR.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE VICE
PRESIDENT LITERALLY TOLD ME TO.
THAT'S A PRETTY SOLID DEFENSE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM GOING TO RULE ON THIS.
IF THERE'S ONE LEGAL PRECEDENT
SET BY THIS CASE, IT SHOULD BE
FOR GOD'S SAKE IGNORE JOE BIDEN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
