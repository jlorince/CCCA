I'M 50.
CAN CAN TELL YOU WHY GUY WHO WILL FIND HIM ROLLING IN JACK LEW DOODLE STACKS AS MONEY WILL
SOON BE CALLED, AL GORE.
>> FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE SAY RICHER MAN TONIGHT ABOUT $100 MILLION RICHER AFTER
SELLING HIS LITTLE WATCHED CABLE CHANNEL CURRENT TV TO THE ARAB NEWS CHANNEL AL JAZEERA.
>> Jon: OH, MAN!
FORMER DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENT TURNED CLIMATE-CHANGE CRUSADER SELLS OPENLY LIBERAL CABLE
CHANNEL TO A MUSLIM.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I THINK WE HAVE OUR FIRST FOX BONER ALERT OF 2013.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> AL JAZEERA OWNED BY THE OIL SHEIK DOM OF QATAR, RIGHT.
BIG GORE WHO HATES BIG OIL IS MAKING A TON OF MONEY BY SELLING IT TO BIG OIL.
>> Jon: IT'S A LEGITIMATE POINT, ACTUALLY.
YOU WOULD THINK IF WOE SELL TO TOMS OF MAINE OR PEDAL AIR, THE WORLD'S ONLY BICYCLE BASED AIRLINE.
WELL PLAYED, FOX.
YOU GOT HIM.
>> AS IT TURNS OUT THE LIBERAL MULTIMILLIONAIRE MOGUL TRIED TO PUSH TO COMPLETE A DEAL TO SELL
HIS CURRENT TV CHANNEL TO AL JAZEERA BEFORE ANY OF NEW TAX HIKES WOULD AFFECT THE PAYDAY.
>> EVEN THOUGH HE WAS SCRAMBLING IT DIDN'T GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY 2.
>> Jon: SO IT'S LESS OF A BURN.
YOU KNOW, AL GORE ALMOST RECEIVED SOMETHING HE REALLY WANTED BUT MISSED IT BY A HAIR
DUE TO A MATH MAT CALL TECH TECHNICALITY ALSO KNOWN AS THE AL GORE STORY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
FOX DOESN'T HAVE TO THE CALL DOESN'T LOOK LIKES IF A FOUR HOUR OWE -- ERECTION.
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE.
AL GORE SOLD HIS CABLE NETWORK TO -- WAIT FOR IT -- AL GENTLEMAN ZEER THE ANTI-AMERICAN NETWORK.
>> HE SELLS HIS NEWS NETWORK TO A CLEARLY ANTI-AMERICAN NEWS CHANNEL CALLED AL JAZEERA.
>> NOW YOU HIT ON IT.
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
>> THAT IS JUST CRAZY.
>> Jon: THAT MEANS MUSLIMS WILL BE ABLE TO SEE INTO OUR HOMES.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
PEOPLE ON TV CAN SEE INTO YOUR HOMES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW, LOOK, AL JAZEERA'S ARABIC CHANNEL HAS BROADCAST SOME VERY HATEFUL STUFF.
WORST HANUKKAH SPECIAL EVER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THAT IS HATEFUL.
ALTHOUGH THE NETWORK THAT WOULD AIR IN CURRENT'S PLACE ISN'T THE AL JAZEERA THAT RUNS IN THE ARAB
WORLD IT'S AL JAZEERA ENGLISH.
BUT IT'S A SUB SUBSIDIARY OF WHO THEY SOLD TO.
LET'S LOOK AT THE PROGRAMS.
[SPEAKING ARABIC]
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> Jon: YOU KNOW IF THAT WERE TRUE WOULD YOU THINK MATZOH WOULD BE FOR FLAVORFUL.
IT'S ALL OF.
THAT DIDN'T AIR ON AL JAZEERA.
IT AIR ON ANOTHER TELEVISION STATION OWNED BY A SAUDI PRINCE AND 20% AFTER THIS IS OWNED BY A
GUY NAMED RUPERT MURDOCH.
THAT LAST NAME IS FAMILIAR BUT I CAN'T PLACE WHAT HIS OTHER HOLDINGS ARE.
BUT THAT IS THE SAME NETWORK THAT AIR VALLEY OF THE WOVLES WHERE AMERICAN SOLDIERS THE BAD
GUYS MASSACRING CIVILIANS AND STEALING ARAB ORGANS TO SELL THEM TO JEWS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
RUPERT MURDOCH PROFITING FROM THE ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA.
WORDS FAIL ME.
>> LET'S NOT FORGET WHAT IT'S KNOWN FOR.
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE ANTI-AMERICAN NETWORK.
>> A CLEARLY ANTI-AMERICAN NETWORK CALLED ROTANA.
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THANK IS CRAZY.
>> Jon: A DEGREE WITH YOU GUYS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
