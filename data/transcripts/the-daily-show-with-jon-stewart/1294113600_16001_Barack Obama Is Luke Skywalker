TO SAY TO YOU [WHINNIES]
WE'VE BEEN AWAY TWO WEEKS TIMING
THE BREAK WITH THE HOLIDAY NEWS
LULL.
WE WON'T BLOW OUT OF TOWN WHEN
IMPORTANT (bleep) IS GOING
DOWN.
WE'RE NOT THE GOVERNOR OF NEW
JERSEY.
OH, YEAH, I'M WRONG.
WHERE DID WE LEAVE?
WE WERE RIDICULING THE
DEMOCRATS.
WE WERE NOT ALONE.
>> THE OBAMA AGENDA IS DEAD.
>> 65 SEATS TURNED OVER IN THE
HOUSE HAS PUT A NAIL IN THE
PRESIDENT'S COFFIN.
>> OBAMA IS IN TROUBLE.
>> THERE'S NO HOPE FOR OBAMA.
>> INCAPABLE OF ACCOMPLISHING
ANYTHING OF ANY SIGNIFICANT
SUCCESS, THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA
IS DEAD.
>> AHHH.
NO-BAMA.
THE AUDACITY OF DOPE.
DREAMS FROM MY ASS.
[LAUGHTER]
>> YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MOCK
THAT ONE UP?
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO -- OF
COURSE, THEN I WENT AWAY TO MY
WINTER HOME ON THREE WEEKS
BEHIND ISLAND ON THE -- COULD
HAVE THE COAT OF PUERTO FAKE-O.
I THOUGHT I WOULD LOOK ON AIR TO
MAKE IT MORE OF A SPECTACLE.
>> TAX SHIELD TO PROTECT THE
UNEMPLOYED.
>> THE 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS
BILL.
>> THE REPEAL OF DON'T ASK,
DON'T TELL.
>> THE OVERHAUL OF FOOD SAFETY
LAWS.
>> ALONG WITH THE NUCLEAR
WEAPONS TREATY WITH RUSSIA.
>> DID QUITE WELL.
>> Jon: HOLY CRAP-O DEMOCRATS
YOU NEED TO LOSE MID TERM
ELECTIONS MORE OFTEN.
IT SUITS YOU.
IF YOU COMPLETELY LOSE THE
SENATE WE COULD SOLVE THE
IMMIGRATION PROBLEM.
[LAUGHTER]
THE PRONUNCIATIONS OF A
ADMINISTRATION'S DEMISE FOLLOWED
BY A MULTITUDE OF POLITICAL
VICTORIES THE SCANDALS MUST
BE -- THIS CAN MEAN ONLY ONE
THING TO THE
COIN-PHRASE-O-METER.
>> PRESIDENT IS THE COMEBACK
KID.
>> IS HE THE COMEBACK KID?
>> HE IS THE COMEBACK KID.
>> COMEBACK KID.
>> Jon: YOU WERE THE ONLY ONES
WHO SAID HE WAS DEAD.
THE MEDIA IS THE WORLD'S WORST
PARAMEDIC.
THEY DECLARE PEOPLE DEAD WHEN
THEY ARE NAPPING SO, OF COURSE,
WAKING UP MUST BE A MIRACLE.
OBAMA IS NOT THE COMEBACK KID.
IT'S JUST A RIGHT TO WAY OF --
TRITE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT.
HE'S LUKE SKYWALKER.
COME WHDH ME TO THE PREMISE
MOBILE.
IT STARTED A LONG TIME WHEN A
SKINNY KID WITH A FUNNY NAME
CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND AGAINST
ALL ODDS.
>> BARACK OBAMA CANNOT CLOSE THE
DEAL.
>> IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
>> Jon: HE DEIFIED OUTRAGEOUS
ODDS TO -- DEIFIED OUTRAGEOUS
ODDS TO WIN THE ELECTION.
HE WON THE ELECTION AND THE
HEARS OF THE PEOPLE.
♪ ♪
-- HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]
♪ ♪
OH (bleep) BIDEN IS THERE ANY
MOMENT YOU CAN'T RUIN?
[LAUGHTER]
THE PRESIDENT TAKES POWER,
ENJOYS THE TRAPPINGS OF OFFICE,
INVITE HIS FAVORITE MUSICIANS
OVER TO ENTERTAINMENT HIM.
STEVIE WONDER HAS NO IDEA HOW
WEIRD HIS BAND LOOKS.
[LAUGHTER]
MEANWHILE, THE REPUBLIC-KIN
EMPIRE GROWS STRONGER.
NOW WE'RE GOING TO THE SECOND
MOVIE WHICH IS REALLY MOVIE
FIVE.
THE PRESIDENT FINDS HIS EFFORTS
TO CLOSE GUANTANAMO BAY STIFLED.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS
STAGNANT P. EFFORTS TO SHUT DOWN
AN OIL SPILL ARE BUNGLED WHILE A
FIERCE POTENTIAL RIVAL STALKS
HIM FROM ALASKA.
[LAUGHTER]
BY THE WAY THAT'S --
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
-- THAT'S FROM THE REALITY SHOW.
I BELIEVE THAT IS FROM THE
REALITY SHOW SARAH PALIN'S SHE
CLAIMS SHE CAN SEE TATUINE FROM
HER HOUSE.
NERD SLAM!
BOOM!
I'M SLOWLY LOSING AUDIENCE
SHARE.
[LAUGHTER]
IT ALL CULMINATES IN A CRUSHING
MID TERM ELECTION DEFEAT AND
MAKING OUT WITH HIS OWN SISTER
CAN'T EASE THE PAIN.
IT'S NOT A PERFECT ANALOGY.
SO --
[LAUGHTER]
TO COMPLETE THE THE TRILOGY,
BARACK OBAMA HEADS OFF TO WORK
OUT A COMPROMISE AFTER
REPUBLICANS DECLARE THEY'LL DO
NOTHING UNLESS TAX CUTS ARE
EXTENDED.
CALM DOWN CHRIS MATTHEWS HE IS
TRYING TO BE BIPARTISAN.
AGAINST ALL ODDS THE DEMOCRATS
MANAGE TO DEFEAT AN INCREDIBLY
WELL ARMED AND WELL OILED
MACHINES USING STONE, BIND AND A
WELL PLACED LOG.
THEY GAINED SIGNIFICANT
LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES.
♪ ♪
CLEARLY, I BELIEVE, THAT WAS
THEM CELEBRATING AFTER DON'T
ASK, DON'T TELL WAS REPEALED.
[LAUGHTER]
AND SO -- AND SO OUR HEROS RIDE
OFF INTO THE SUNSET.
NOTHING ELSE IN THE WAY.
>> WHILE THE OBAMA'S VACATIONED
IN HAWAII THE STATE'S GOVERNOR
IS DIVING INTO THE CONTROVERSY
OVER WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS
BORN.
>> Jon: PREQUEL, DAMMIT.
