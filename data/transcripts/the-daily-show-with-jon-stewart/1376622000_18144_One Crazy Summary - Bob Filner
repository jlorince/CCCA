IF YOU MISSED THAT I'M TRULY
SORRY.
SOME STORIES HAVE ALSO
DEVELOPED SINCE WE COVERED
THEM.
AND I JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY
UPDATE YOU ON THEM.
TIDDY EVERYTHING UP BEFORE
JON GETS BACK HERE.
FIRST YOU MIGHT REMEMBER
ACCUSED SEXUAL HARASSER AND
ASSAULTER BOB FILLNER BEST
KNOWN FOR HIS WORK AS THE
SAN DIEGO MAYOR, AS WELL ASS
HAD HIS ROLE OPPOSITE
MICHAEL KEATON IN 1989'S
BATMAN.
NOW THAT MIGHT SEEN LIKE A
CRUEL JOKE ABOUT SOMEONE'S
APPEARANCE.
IN MY DEFENSE, [BLEEP] THIS
GUY.
(APPLAUSE)
>> THAT'S MY DEFENSE.
OVER A DOZEN FEMALE
EMPLOYEES HAVE ACCUSED
FILLNER OF UNWANTED SEXUAL
ADVANCEMENT BUT NOW IT SEEMS
HIS MISSIVES MAY NOT HAVE
STOPPED THERE.
>> INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING
INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF
IMPROVE CHARGES ON HIS CITY
CREDIT CARD.
>> WORKING INTO A JUNKET
PHILNER TOOK A-- THAT
APPEARS TO HAVE LITTLE TO DO
TO SAN DIEGO AND COST
TAXPAYERS $30,000.
$3,000 TO AN ON-LINE
REPUTATION MANAGEMENT FIRM.
AND ODDLY, 128 DOLLARS FOR A
JUICER.
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
THE JOOUTSER-- JUICER IS THE
THING YOU FIND ODD THERE?
NOT THE $3,000 ON REPUTATION
MANAGEMENT?
BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING
THE CITY CLEARLY DOES
DESERVE A REFUN ON.
THERE IS ALSO ONE OTHER
RECENT REVELATION ABOUT BOB
FILLNER THAT I HESITATE TO
EVEN SHOW YOU.
>> THERE ARE NEW ALLEGATIONS
THAT MAYOR FILLNER SEXUALLY
HARASSED MILITARY RAPE
VICTIMS.
>> THAT MAY BE THE SINGLE
WORST SENTENCE I HAVE HEARD
ALL SUMMER.
EVEN A KISS ON THE HEAD FROM
REGIS PHIL PIN CANNOT ERASE
THE PAIN OF HEARING THAT.
IF I PAY, I WOULD LIKE TO DO
A QUICK IMPRESSION OF BOB
FILLNER'S REPUTATION MANAGER
AFTER HEARING THAT SENTENCE.
UM, OKAY, [BLEEP] THIS.
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR $3,000
BACK.
LIFE'S TOO SHORT YOU PIECE
