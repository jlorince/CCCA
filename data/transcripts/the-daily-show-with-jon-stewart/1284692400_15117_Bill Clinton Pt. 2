[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: PLEASE WELCOME BACK.
WE'RE HERE WITH FORMER PRESIDENT
CLINTON.
LET'S TALK.
OBVIOUSLY THE MID TERMS ARE
COMING UP IN YOUR BOOK, YOU
MENTION THAT YOU WENT OUT ON THE
ROAD FOR THE MID TERM ELECTIONS
IN 1994.
YOU FELT THAT MAYBE THAT WASN'T
THE THING YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE
AS PRESIDENT.
IT MAYBE THROUGH YOU INTO A
BATTLE THAT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
NEED TO.
DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA
SHOULD CAMPAIGN IN THAT MANNER?
>> I DO.
>> Jon: YOU THINK HE SHOULD
THIS TIME.
HOW CAN HE AVOID THE TRAP YOU
FELT LIKE YOU FELL?
>> WE HAD A DIFFERENT PROBLEM.
AT THAT TIME NEWT GINGRICH HAD
COME OUT WITH HIS CONTRACT ON
AMERICA OR CONTRACT FOR AMERICA
HE CALLED IT.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
AND OUR GUYS DIDN'T DO THAT.
AND SO I WAS IN A POSITION OF
BASICALLY DOING ONE TO HELP
PEOPLE -- YOU CAN'T TURN DOWN
PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR YOU, PUT
THEIR SEATS AT RISK.
I DON'T THINK I DID A VERY GOOD
JOB OF EXPLAINING WHAT WE HAD
DONE.
BUT WE HAD A VERSION OF WHAT HE
IS FACING NOW WHICH IS THAT WE
HAD DONE THINGS THAT WERE
BRINGING THE ECONOMY BACK BUT NO
ONE FELT IT BACK.
THAT'S TRUE HERE ON STEROIDS.
IT'S HORRIBLE.
BASICALLY JUST IN THE LAST WEEK
THERE WERE TWO INDEPENDENT
ECONOMIC SURVEYS.
ONE SAID IF WE HAD NO STIMULUS
UNEMPLOYMENT WOULD BE 11% NOT
9.5% AND THE OTHER SAID IF WE
HAD NO STIMULUS OR SAVED THE
BANKING SYSTEM AND IF INTEREST
RATES WEREN'T NEARLY 0 BY THE
FEDERAL RESERVE THERE WOULD BE
8.5 MILLION PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED.
IF YOU CAN'T PAY YOUR MORTGAGE
AND YOUR MORTGAGE IS WORTH MORE
THAN YOUR HOUSE AND YOU THINK
YOU NEVER CAN SEND YOUR KID TO
COLLEGE AND YOU ARE MISERABLE
AND YOU LOOK AND SAY GOSH, THE
PEOPLE WHO CAUSED THIS CRISIS,
THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, THEY ARE
DOING FINE AND THE GOVERNMENT
GUYS THEY ARE DOING FINE, WHEN
AM I GOING TO GET ANY HELP?
IT'S A COMBUSTIBLE MIX.
IT MAKES PEOPLE ANGRY.
THEY OUGHT TO BE ANGRY.
IT MAY MAKE SOME OF YOUR OWN
SUPPORTERS APATHETIC ABOUT
WHETHER THEY SHOULD VOTE.
YOU SHOULD GO TO THE AREAS WHERE
HE CAN HELP.
THAT'S WHAT HE IS DOING.
HE SHOULD HELP THEM RAISE FUNDS
SO THEY DON'T GET BLOWN AWAY.
A LOT OF BIG BUSINESS GROUPS
THAT -- FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF
PEOPLE WANT TO REPEAL THE HEALTH
CARE BILL BECAUSE THERE'S A
PROVISION IN THE HEALTH CARE
BILL THAT SAYS FROM NOW ON WHEN
THIS BILL TAKES EFFECT 85 CENTS
ON EVERY DOLLAR YOU PAY IN
INSURANCE HAS TO GO TO HEALTH
CARE.
THERE'S A MASSIVE BATTLE IN THE
85 CENTS.
SOME STATES DON'T HAVE THAT.
IN MINNESOTA WHERE THE MAYO
CLINIC HAS SET A MODEL OF TAKING
MONEY TO KEEP YOU HEALTHY.
THAT IS YOU PAY FOR HEALTH CARE
NOT FOR PROCEDURES.
89 CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR GOES TO
HEALTH CARE.
BUT THERE ARE A LOT PLACES WHERE
THERE'S NOT TRUE.
ONLY 11 OF 50 STATES HAVE THE
POWER TO KEEP HEALTH INSURANCE
RATES DOWN EVEN THOUGH ONE OR
TWO FIRMS DOMINATE 80% TO 90% OF
PHARPBLT.
THERE'S MONEY GOING ON THERE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS
AT RISK.
THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO CONTINUE
ZERO ESTATE TAX.
THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO
CONTINUE -- DON'T WANT THEIR TAX
CUT UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH RAISED.
THEY DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO
THE RATE THEY PAID WHEN I WAS
PRESIDENT WHEN I RAISED IT TO
THAT.
BUT OBVIOUSLY, AND I'M IN THAT
INCOME GROUP.
THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT
SUFFERING SHOULD PAY SO THAT
THOSE WHO ARE CAN GET THE JOB
TRAINING THEY NEED, THE GET THE
EDUCATION THEY NEED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: HERE IS WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO.
THIS IS AN INTERESTING
CONVERSATION.
I'M GOING TO THROW TO
COMMERCIAL.
WE'RE GOING TO GO AWAY.
WE'RE GOING TO THROW THE REST ON
THE WEB.
IF YOU THINK THE DEMOCRATS WHO
ARE I SAG, YOU KNOW, GOVERNMENT
SHOULD TAKE A STRONGER ROLE
UNTIL THESE THINGS, ARE V- THEY
MADE THEIR CASE FOR COMPETENCE?
MAYBE WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING I
GET THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO
DO THIS.
DO I TRUST THAT THEY CAN?
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT.
PRESIDENT BILL
