BUT, OF COURSE, THE ARTS ARE NOT
THE ONLY BATTLEFIELD IN OUR
CULTURE WARS.
THIS CONFLICT IS ALSO BEING
FOUGHT IN AND AROUND OUR PEE
HOLE.
>> BIRTH CONTROL FOR WOMEN NOW
GOING TO BE COMPLETELY FREE.
>> NO CO-PAY OR DEDUCTIBLE.
>> I MIGHT BE FOR THAT IF I
DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT
THERE ABLE TO BUY A NEW PAIR OF
SHOES.
>> IF YOU CAN AFFORD A $5
FRAPPUCCINO AT STARBUCKS, YOU
CAN PAY YOUR $5 CO-PAY.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: WHAT IF YOU CAN'T
AFFORD A $5 FRAPPUCCINO AND YET
STILL HAVE GENITALS?
SEE, DANA, AND YOU KNOW I LIKE
YOU VERY MUCH, YOU AND I AS
WELL-KNOWN TELEVISION
PERSONALITIES ARE ABLE TO USE
OUR SALARIES TO LIVE ON AND SET
ASIDE OUR SPEAKING FEES FOR
FRAPPUCCINOS AND CONTRACEPTION.
[LAUGHTER]
NOT EVERYONE CAN.
YET THEY WOULD STILL LIKE TO
KEEP THEIR, AND LET ME USE YOUR
STARBUCKS PARLANCE, TALL FAMILY
FROM BECOMING VENTI.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE THE
SIDES AREN'T THAT FAR APART.
LET'S BREAK DOWN THE ARGUMENT.
>> SUPPORTERS SAY THIS MARKS A
MILESTONE IN WOMEN'S HEALTH
CARE.
BIRTH CONTROL OPPONENTS ARGUE
THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT MESSING
WITH GOD.
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Jon: I SEE.
SO ON THE ONE SIDE THEY'RE
SAYING GREATER ACCESS TO
CONTRACEPTION COULD RESULT IN
$19 BILLION WORTH OF SAVINGS AND
INCREASED HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN
OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD.
