( LAUGHTER )
YESTERDAY, BUSY DAY ON CAPITOL
HILL.
STARTING WITH THE SENATE FINANCE
COMMITTEE GRILLING OF FORMER
I.R.S. COMMISSIONER SCHULMAN AND
MILLER ABOUT ALLEGED TARGETING
OF GROUPS APPLYING FOR 501(c)4
STATUS.
>> I REGRET THAT HAPPENED ON MY
WATCH.
>> Jon:  THAT WAS IN STARK
CONTRAST TO THAT MAN'S PREVIOUS
APPEARANCE BEFORE CONGRESS.
>> YES, I CAN GIVE YOU
ASSURANCES THERE'S ABSOLUTE NO
TARGETING.
>>TARGETING.
>> Jon:  AND OF COURSE BY
"NO" I MEAN LOTS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE WHEN KIDS
SAY SOMETHING'S BAD BUT THEY
REALLY MEAN IT'S GOOD.
AND WHEN THEY SAY SOMETHING'S
PHAT-- WHICH I REALLY DON'T KNOW
ACTUALLY WHAT THAT MEANS, BUT
ANYWAY.
AT THIS HEARING, WE WOULD
FINALLY GET THE DETAILS OF HOW
THESE GROUPS WERE TARGETED AND
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE.
I WANT A FULL ACCOUNTING.
>> I WAS UNAWARE, I BELIEVE, AT
THE TIME, THAT IT HAD HAPPENED.
>> WHEN SOMEONE SPOTTED IT, THEY
SHOULD HAVE RUN UP THE CHAIN,
AND THEY DIDN'T.
>> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THAT.
>> I DIDN'T KNOW AT THAT TIME.
>> I AM NOT AWARE OF THAT.
>> DON'T KNOW.
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> I HAVE NO MEMORY OF ANYONE
DOING THAT.
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.
I'M NOT PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.
>> Jon:  I-- I SHOW UP TO
WORK DRUNK.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ.
I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE I WON A
RADIO CONTEST.
( LAUGHTER )
DOES ANYONE HERE KNOW WHAT THE
HELL HAPPENED?
>> MY NAME IS LOIS LERNER, AND
I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE EXEMPT
ORGANIZATIONS AT THE INTERNAL
REVENUE SERVICE.
>> Jon:  BOOYAH.
( LAUGHTER )
BEAUTIFUL YOU, WERE IN CHARGE OF
THE DIVISION OVERCEASE THESE
501(c)4 APPLICATIONS SO WHAT
DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING
WRONG.
I HAVE NOT BROKEN ANY LAWS.
>> Jon:  WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT BREAKING LAWS.
( LAUGHTER )
WE WERE JUST-- NO ONE'S ACCUSING
YOU.
WE JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED.
>> I'VE DECIDED TO FOLLOW MY
COUNSEL'S ADVICE AND NOT TESTIFY
OR ANSWER ANY OF THE QUESTIONS
TODAY.
>> HER NAME IS LOIS LERNER.
SHE ANNOUNCES THAT SHE'S
INVOKING HER FIFTH AMENDMENT
RIGHT.
>> Jon:  HER FIFTH AMENDMENT
RIGHT!
OH, MY GOD.
SHE'S GOING TO START QUARTERING
SOLDIERS IN HER HOME WITHOUT
PERMISSION.
HOLD ON A SECOND... SHE'S GOING
TO-- OH, SHE'S GIVING HER SLAVES
BACK.
THAT'S NOT RIGHT!
SHE'S REPEALING PROHIBITION?
SHE'S-- NO, WAIT.
SHE'S INVOKING THE RIGHT TO NOT
INCRIMINATE HERSELF.
SO NOTHING FROM HER.
FINE.
WE DON'T NEED YOU.
THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS
COMMITTEE SENT THE I.R.S. A
LETTER DEMANDING ALL ITS
SCANDAL-RELATED PAPERWORK BY MAY
21, AND TODAY IS MAY 20-- MORE

THEY DIDN'T SEND IT?
THE I.R.S. DIDN'T SEND IT IN?
SO THE I.R.S. MISSED THEIR
FILING DEADLINE.
