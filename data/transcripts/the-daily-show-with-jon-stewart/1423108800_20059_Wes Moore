SIR.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )WES MOORE!
SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HOW ARE YOU?
>> IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. I AMDOING GREAT.
I'M DOING GREAT, THANK YOU.
>> Jon:  I'VE KNOWN THISGENTLEMAN FOR A FEW YEARS.
WE'VE DONE SOME WORK TOGETHER.
HE IS ONE OF THE MOST-- IF I MAYSAY SO-- ANNOYING PEOPLE.
YOU'RE SO ACCOMPLISHED AT SUCH AYOUNG AGE, THAT IT ANGERS ME.
( LAUGHTER )>> IT ANGERS ME, TOO,
ACTUALLY.
>> Jon:  STOP IT!
THE BOOK IS CALLED WES MOORE"THE WORK: MY SEARCH FOR
A LIFE THAT MATTERS.">> THANK YOU.
>> Jon: YOU'VE SERVED IN IRAQAND AFGHANISTAN.
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE STATEDEPARTMENT.
YOU'VE WRITTEN THIS IS YOURSECOND BOOK, YOU'RE WHAT ARE
YOU NOW, 28, 32,SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
>> 36.
YEAH.
>> Jon:  WHAT-- WHAT GIVESYOU THAT DRIVE?
WHAT-- WHAT IS IT THAT YOU FOUNDIN YOUR LIFE THAT CAUSES YOU TO
HAVE THIS DRIVE?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK PARTOF IT IS THIS THING ABOUT MY
CHILDHOOD, RIGHT?
I MEAN, I HAD A DIFFICULTCHILDHOOD WHERE I, YOU KNOW,
I CAME UP IN, YOU KNOW, PRETTYTROUBLED COMMUNITIES.
I WATCHED MY FATHER DIE WHEN IWAS FOUR.
I FIRST FELT HAND CUFFS ON MYWRIST WHEN I WAS 11 YEARS OLD.
AND I REMEMBER THEN GOINGTHROUGH THIS EVOLUTION, AND EVEN
THE TIME COMING BACK FROMAFGHANISTAN WHERE, YOU KNOW,
I WANTED TO FIND WHAT DIDTHAT MEAN TO BE SUCCESSFUL?
WHAT DID ALL OF THAT REALLY MEANIN MY OWN LIFE?
AND I FELT LIKE IN THIS QUESTAND THIS JOURNEY, MY
UNDERSTANDING, MY DEFINITION OFTHE WORK REALLY BECAME WERE YOUR
GREATEST GIFTS AND YOUR GREATESTSKILL SETS BEGIN TO START
OVERLAPPING WITH THE WORLD'SGREATEST NEEDS AND THEN YOU
CHOSE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
SO PART OF THE REASON WHY IWANTED TO TELL THIS STORY AND
WRITE THIS BOOK WAS FIRSTIT WAS ALMOST LIKE A REAL-TIME
EXPLORATION IN MY OWN LIFE -->> Jon: RIGHT.
>> ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT BUT THENALSO HIGHLIGHTING THESE
OTHER PEOPLE WHO I JUST DREW ATREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INSPIRATION
FROM, ABOUT FINDING WHAT ITMEANT IN MY OWN LIFE TO BE
RELEVANT AND TRULY COME ALIVE.
>> Jon: SEE THIS-- THIS-- WHATYOU ARE SAYING STRIKES ME AS THE
KEY.
IT IS BRINGING PURPOSE.
AND I KNOW ONE OF YOUR GREATESTCAUSES IS HELPING VETERANS
REINGRATE, ONCE THEY'RE DONEWITH THE WAR.
I THINK THIS IS SUCH THE KEY.
SO MUCH OF OUR PERCEPTION OF ITIS, OH, LET'S HELP THEM.
>> YEAH.
>> WHEN REALLY, THEIR ENTIREBEING IS, NO, WE SERVE.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
LET US CONTINUE TO SERVESOMEHOW.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY --
>> Jon: AND YOU FOUND A WAY TOINTEGRATE THAT ETHOS.
>> AND HOW DO YOU FIND YOURGREATNESS, RIGHT?
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> WHERE BECAUSE I THINKTHAT THE ONE THING THAT ALL
PEOPLE WHO ARE GREAT AT WHATTHEY DO, THE ONE THING ALL OF
THEM HAVE IN COMMON IS THEY AREPASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT THEY DO.
AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS, YOUKNOW, FIRST LEAVING THE WHITE
HOUSE AND HEAD BACK TO NEWYORK, AND I WAS GOING TO GO
WORK IN FINANCE, AND I REMEMBERSPEAKING WITH A MENTOR OF MINE
AND HE SAID, YOU'RE GOING TO GOBACK TO THE FINANCE.
AND I WAS EXPLAINING TO HIM WHYAND NOT ONE THING CAME OUT OF MY
MOUTH THAT ACTUALLY SAID BECAUSEI WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT IT.
AND HE SAID TO ME, HE SAID,LISTEN, IF YOU NEED TO GO THERE,
AND GO, AND DO WHAT YOU NEEDTO DO, BUT THE MOMENT YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU CAN LEAVE, LEAVE,BECAUSE EVERY DAY YOU'RE
DOING WHAT YOU'RE NOT PASSIONATEABOUT YOU BECOME
EXTRAORDINARILY ORDINARY.
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS FOR ALLOF US, WE NEED TO FIND THAT
THING THAT MAKES USEXTRAORDINARY.
FIND THAT THING THAT GIVES USOUR GREATNESS --
>> Jon: RIGHT.
>> AND THEN GO AFTER ITBECAUSE THAT'S ONLY WAY THAT
YOU'LL FIND THAT LEVELOF FULFILLMENT.
>> Jon:  OR EVEN HAVING THATDESIRE.
BUT HOW DO YOU INSTILL THAT--AND SO YOU GROW UP IN TROUBLED
COMMUNITIES.
YOU'RE WORKING WITH A COMMUNITYOF PEOPLE TRYING TO ADJUST TO
COMING BACK.
HOW DO YOU INSTILL THAT?
HOW DO YOU GO INTO THOSECOMMUNITIES AND CONVINCE THEM
THAT THAT'S WORTH ACCOMPLISHINGAND THAT THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH IT,
AND THAT THEY'RE NOT SISYPHUSPUSHING A STONE UP A HILL ONLY
TO HAVE IT ROLL BACK DOWN ONTHEM OR THAT MAYBE THAT THAT'S
OKAY.
>> NO, YEAH. WELL, I THINK, YOUKNOW, I REMEMBER MY MOTHER TOLD
ME SOMETHING ONCE WHERE SHESAID THAT A PERSON NEEDS
TO THINK THAT YOU CARE BEFORETHEY CARE WHAT YOU THINK.
AND SO I THINK THE FIRST THINGIS THAT YOU HAVE TO SHOW PEOPLE
THAT YOUR LEVEL OF SINCERITY ISGENUINE, AND YOU HAVE AS MUCH A
VESTED INTEREST IN THEM AS THEYSHOULD HAVE IN YOU.
AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUTSOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WE
FEATURED AND PROFILEDIN "THE WORK" RIGHT?
I MEAN, A WOMAN WHO WAS INBOSTON --
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> WHO STARTED A BUSINESS
CALLED, YOU KNOW, CALLED -- THATACTUALLY WORKS AS AN
APPAREL COMPANY, AND THE ONLYPEOPLE SHE EMPLOYS ARE SINGLE
MOTHERS WHO LIVE IN POVERTY,FROM THE TOP OF THE ORGANIZATION
TO THE BOTTOM OF THEORGANIZATION.
>> Jon: RIGHT.>> AS A TRIBUTE TO HER MOTHER.
OR THE PERSON, A GUY NAMEDMICHAEL HANCOCK WHO GREW UP IN A
REALLY TOUGH ENVIRONMENT INDENVER AND HIS ONLY DEFINITION
OF SUCCESS WAS LEAVING DENVER.THAT WAS THE ONLY -- ONCE HE
SAID I LEAVE DENVER, I'VE MADEIT --
>> Jon: I HEAR THAT FROMA LOT OF PEOPLE.
>> A LOT, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW?
>> Jon: IT'S A WONDERFUL CITY.
>> IT'S A GREAT CITY.
>> Jon: I'M TERRIBLE.
>> SO MICHAEL HANCOCK,MICHAEL HANCOCK WHOSE DEFINITION
OF SUCCESS WAS LEAVINGDENVER, IS CURRENTLY
THE MAYOR OF DENVER.
HE REALIZES THAT SOMETIMES THETHING THAT YOU'RE MOST AFRAID
OF, THE THING THAT GIVES YOU THEMOST PAIN IS ACTUALLY THE THING
YOU NEED TO RUN TO WITH ALL OFYOUR MIGHT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU
FIND YOUR JOY.
>> Jon: RIGHT. IT'S ABOUTPURPOSE.
>> IT'S ABOUT PURPOSE.
>> Jon: WILL YOU, WILL YOU STAYFOR JUST A LITTLE BIT?
WE'VE GOT TO GO. BUT WE'LL GO TOTHE WEB.
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BITMORE ABOUT SPECIFICALLY THE
PROGRAMS YOU'RE WORKING WITH FORVETERANS AND THEN HOW TO TAKE
THIS TO SCALE BECAUSE I THINKTHAT'S THE NEXT LEVEL IS HOW DO
SCALE THIS AND MAKE IT?>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
>> Jon: SO, WE'LL COME BACK.
"THE WORK" IS ON THE BOOKSHELVESRIGHT NOW.
WES, ALWAYS NICE TO SEE YOU.
SUCH A GOOD MAN.
WES MOORE, GET THE BOOK NOW.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
