>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILYSHOW."
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
VERY GOOD SHOW TONIGHT.MY GUEST TONIGHT, OH,
ONE OF OUR FAVORITES THERE, MR.FAREED ZAKARIA.
FAREED ZAKARIA WILL BE JOININGUS ON THE PROGRAM TONIGHT.
PEOPLE ARE HOOTING BECAUSEAPPARENTLY TONIGHT AT "THE DAILY
SHOW" IT'S CHUCK E. CHEESENIGHT.
EVERYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE, IT'STHEIR BIRTHDAY, THE ENTIRE,
ENTIRE AUDIENCE.
BUT FIRST, WE'VE THROWN CERTAINPUBLIC FIGURES A FAIR AMOUNT OF
SHADE FOR ONE PARTICULARUNSEEMLY DINING HABIT,
THE PIZZA WITH A FORK.
IT'S, IT'S THE GREATEST SIN ANEW YORKER CAN COMMIT NEXT TO,
OBVIOUSLY, DOING CARNAL THINGSWITH AN ONION BAGEL.
LOOK, MY POINT IS THIS,IT TURNS OUT WE GOT
OURSELVES A REPEAT OFFENDER.
>> BILL DE BLASIO AND HIS FAMILYARRIVED IN NAPLES TODAY.
>> HE WAS AGAIN CAUGHT USING AFORK AND KNIFE WHILE DINING WITH
HIS FAMILY AT APIZZERIA IN NAPLES.
THE MAYOR SAYS IT'S IN KEEPINGWITH PEOPLE AND HOW THEY EAT
THEIR SLICES THERE.
>> Jon: OH, YEAH, BLAME IT ONTHE LOCALS.
SURE, YEAH, CLASSIC.
ALTHOUGH I DO GUESS IF HE JUSTDID PICK UP HIS PIZZA SLICE AND
EAT IT WITH HIS HANDS, I BETTHE ITALIAN "DAILY SHOW"
WOULD HAVE HAD A FIELD DAY ONHIM.
[LAUGHTER]WOW, THAT GUY REALLY MUGS FOR
THE CAMERA.
WRITE SOME JOKES.
HERE'S MY FAVORITE PART OF THIS.
KEEP YOUR EYE ON DEBLASIO'S DAUGHTER CHIARA.
SHE'S ANTICIPATING THE REACTIONBACK IN THE STATES WITH AN
INTERNATIONAL GESTURE.
[LAUGHTER]THAT'S AN INTERNATIONAL GESTURE
THAT CAN ONLY BE CALLED, "YOUWORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN [BLEEPED]
LUNCH." YOU KNOWWHAT, MAYBE EATING PIZZA WITH
A KNIFE AND FORKISN'T SO NEW YORK, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT'S PURE NEW YORK,THE ESSENCE OF THIS
GREAT CITY?
FINDING A NEW NON-VERBAL WAY OFTELLING SOMEONE TO [BLEEPED]
OFF.
WE MISS YOU GUYS.
