WARM.
IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK SINCE
KEITH OLBERMANN AND MSNBC PARTED
WAYS LEAVING AN OBER MAN-SHAPED
HOLE IN OUR NATIONAL DISCOURSE.
WHO ON THEIR NETWORK WILL STEP
INTO THE BREACH?
WE FIND OUT IN OUR NEW SEGMENT
"OLBERTUNITY KNOCKS."
>> HAVE YOU NO SENSE OF DECENCY,
SIR?
>> Jon: THE MOST OFTEN CONTENDER
RACHEL MAD DOE.
PASSIONATE, LIBERAL.
CHECK.
GLASSES.
CHECK.
RAILS MERCILESSLY AGAINST ALL
HER OPPOSE HER VIEW POINT.
>> RICHARD COHEN AUTHOR OF THE
BOOK "COMING OUT STRAIGHT,
UNDERSTANDING AND HEALING
HOMOSEXUALITY."
MR. COHEN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR BEING WITH US TONIGHT.
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME
RACHEL.
>> Jon: WHAT WAS THAT?
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT PART OF YOU DISAGREE WITH
THIS PERSON DON'T YOU GET?
WATCH AND LEARN, MADDOW.
>> THE LEADING TERRORIST GROUP
IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IS THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
>> KARL ROVE IS AN IDIOT.
A MONKEY POSING AS A NEWSCASTER.
THE TOTAL MINDLESS OR INLY
BANKRUPT KNEE JERK HATRED
WITHOUT WHICH MICHELLE MALKIN
WOULD BE A BIG BASHED UP BAG OF
MEAT WITH LIPSTICK ON IT.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YEAH, THAT'S THE STUFF!
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT, SHE CAN'T DO IT.
ANYBODY ELSE GONNA STEP UP?
>> I HAVE SAID BEFORE THAT SHE
HAS ZOMBIE-LIKE QUALITIES.
I CALL HEAR BALLOON HEAD FOR A
REASON.
I THINK SHE'S A BALLOON HEAD.
YOU HAVE TO USE THE WORD
"BALLOON HEAD."
BALLOON HEAD.
BALLOON HEAD.
SHE'S A BALLOON HEAD.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IT'S GOOD, BUT I THINK
YOU MAY HAVE TO COME UP WITH
MORE THAN ONE INSULT.
AND NOT FOR NOTHING, JUDGING BY
THE SIZE OF YOUR CRANIUM...
(LAUGHTER)
... I WOULD GO WITH AN INSULT
YOU YOURSELF DO NOT SUFFER FROM.
(LAUGHTER)
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HELIUM
HOUSES...
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT ABOUT THE GUY WHO GOT
KEITH'S OLD TIME SLOT, LAWRENCE
O'DONNELL?
LET'S SEE HOW HE'S DOING.
>> SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT
THE BULLET CAPACITY OF THESE
WEAPONS BUT NEWSPAPERS FROM THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" TO THE....
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
SLOW TALKER.
GUYS, OLER MAN WAS A FIVE POOL
PLAYER, WAGE, EGO, WIT,
SCHOLARSHIP.
AFTER YOU DELIVER A RANT, I WANT
TO FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TWO WEEKS
OFF AND A BLOOD TRANSFUSION.
THAT THING THAT I SAID.
(LAUGHTER)
IS THERE NO ONE ON MSNBC THAT
CAN SHOULDER THIS OLBER-BURDEN?
>> EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID TO
ME IS FALSE!
GET THIS IDIOT OFF MY RADIO
SHOW!
>> Jon: WHAT WAS THAT?
>> YOU'RE TOO STUPID TO READ!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THIS SOUNDS PROMISING.
IT'S ED SCHULTZ HOST OF THE
CREATIVELY NAMED "ED SHOW."
WHAT'S HE GOT TO OFFER?
>> THE REPUBLICANS LIE!
I KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.
THEY WANT TO TAKE DOWN AMERICAN
WORKERS.
THEY WANT TO OUTSOURCE JOBS.
THEY WANT TO SEE YOU DEAD!
I WILL FIGHT THESE BASTARDS
EVERY NIGHT AT 6:00.
THEY'D RATHER MAKE MONEY OFF
YOUR DEAD CORPSE!
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: YES, ONLY ED SCHULTZ CAN
HELP RID AMERICA OF NECK ROE
FEEL YAK PIMPS.
(LAUGHTER)
STILL, THOUGH, GREAT ENERGY.
I LOVE THE RAGE, I LOVE TO SIGH
THE INSULTS MORE PERSONAL.
BUT IN A MORE SELF-UNAWARE WAY.
>> REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF NEW
JERSEY CHRIS CHRISTIE, I MEAN,
THIS GUY IS NOTHING BUT A BIG
BULLY.
HE'S A COLD-HEARTED FAT SLOB
ANYWAY.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHEN HE
DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE HEARS, HE
ACCUSES THE OTHER SIDE OF
SHOUTING.
IT'S A TYPICAL, TYPICAL
RIGHT-WING APPROACH TO THE
COMPETITION.
>> Jon: YES.
IF THERE'S ONE THING MR. SCHULTZ
CAN'T STAND IT'S A HEAVY-SET MAN
SHOUTING AT YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
I GUESS IF THERE WAS EVER A SHOW
CALLED "OLBERMANN'S ID" HE COULD
HAVE THAT.
IT'S CLEAR MSNBC DID NOT PLAN
FOR THE EVENTUALITY OF OLER
MAN'S DEPARTURE.
TO TRULY BE ASSURE OF A
RIGHTFULARY ONE WOULD HAVE TO
RAISE THE BROADCASTER FROM
SCRATCH, BEEF FROM THE FINALEST
COWS, VINEGAR FROM THE SOUREST
GROUPS AND A HUMAN EXPERIMENT AS
DIABOLICAL AS IT IS GENIUS.
TO THE OLBER-FARM!
YES!
(CHILDREN SHOUTING)
>> HAVE YOU NO SHAME?
HAVE YOU NO SHAME?
>> IT'S A BASIC SOCIAL CAUSE!
>> Jon: (LAUGHS)
