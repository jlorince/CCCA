"DEATH OF A KING." IT'SFANTASTIC.
BUT FIRST, WE TURN TO ISIS.
THE TERRORIST INSURGENT GROUPSLASH ROGUE NATION, SLASH
ALL-AROUND LIVING NIGHTMARE,SLASH-NILE RIVER MUD OSIRIS
PENIS RECONSTITUTER. YES, ISIS.DIFFERENT ISIS. THAT ISIS.
SHE REMADE HER HUSBAND, NILERIVER MUD PENIS FIRST.
I'M JUST REPORTING WHAT I KNOW!
YOU KNOW, OUR PRESIDENT HASSPENT THE PAST FEW WEEKS WORKING
ON A STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITHTHE ISIS TERRORISTS, TO REPLACE
OUR PREVIOUS STRATEGY OF... NOTHAVING A STRATEGY.
NOW TYPICALLY THE PRESIDENT HASBEEN QUITE MEASURED WHEN IT
COMES TO MILITARY FORCE.
>> WHY IS IT THAT EVERYBODY'S SOEAGER TO USE MILITARY FORCE?
THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO SYRIAIS NOT SIMPLY A MILITARY ISSUE.
WE CAN NOT USE FORCE EVERYWHERETHAT A RADICAL IDEOLOGY TAKES
ROOT. WHAT WE'RE NOT GOING TOBE ABLE TO DO IS TO
PLAY WHACK-A-MOLE AND CHASEWHEREVER EXTREMISTS APPEAR.
>> Jon: LET ME TELL YOUSOMETHING ABOUT EXTREMIST
WHACK-A-MOLE. IT MAY BE MY LEASTFAVORITE WHACK-A-MOLE.
EVEN IF YOU WHACK EVERYEXTREMIST, WHAT DO YOU WIN?
ENOUGH TICKETS FOR A SLAPBRACELET?
THAT HARDLY SEEMS, HARDLY SEEMSA PROPER RETURN ON $3 TRILLION.
THE REPUBLICANS, OF COURSE, DOHAVE A STRATEGY.
>> IF I'M THE PRESIDENT, I'MGONNA SAY LOOK, I'M GONNA KILL
EVERY ONE OF THESE BASTARDS.
>> KILL EVERY ONE OF THESES.O.B.s.
>> BOMB THEM BACK TO THE STONEAGE.
>> WHACK THOSE SUCKERS.
>> POUND THEM AND POUND THEM.
>> BLOW THEM TO SMITHEREENS.
>> SCORCH THE EARTH.
>> WIPE THEM OUT ALL OF THEM.
>> Jon:  NOW THAT LAST ONE, THATWAS UNFAIR TO USE THAT LAST ONE.
MR. CHENEY IS NO LONGER INOFFICE.
I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHTTO PUT HIM UP THERE.
THE POINT IS, WE APPEAR TO BE ATA CROSSROADS BETWIXT THE
NUANCED VISION OF ANON-OMNIPOTENT AMERICA
PROJECTING POWER SELECTIVELY ANDSOME SORT OF WEIRD ALL POWERFUL
TARENTINO AMERICA THAT CLEANSESTHE WORLD OF SIN THROUGH SLOW
MOTION BLOOD BATHS.
LAST NIGHT BARACK OBAMA BROKEOUT HIS I KILLED BIN LADEN STRUT
TO DELIVER THE VERDICT!
>> FIRST, WE WILL CONDUCT ASYSTEMATIC CAMPAIGN OF
AIRSTRIKES AGAINST THESETERRORISTS.
WE WILL HUNT DOWN TERRORISTS WHOTHREATEN OUR COUNTRY WHEREVER
THEY ARE.
IF YOU THREATEN AMERICA, YOUWILL FIND NO SAFE HAVEN.
OUR OBJECTIVE IS CLEAR.
WE WILL DEGRADE AND ULTIMATELYDESTROY I.S.I.L.
>> Jon: WE HAVE OUR ANSWER.
(APPLAUSE)ALL RIGHT, WELL, LAST NIGHT,
LAST NIGHT OUR MOM JEANS-WEARINGSOCIALIST MUSLIM DICTATOR TYRANT
PACIFIST WENT FULLAMERICA (BLEEP) YEAH!
>> ABROAD, AMERICAN LEADERSHIPIS THE ONE CONSTANT IN AN
UNCERTAIN WORLD. IT IS AMERICATHAT HAS THE CAPACITY AND THE
WILL TO MOBILIZE THEWORLD AGAINST TERRORISTS.
BUT AS AMERICANS, WE WELCOME OURRESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD.
THE STRATEGY OF TAKING OUTTERRORISTS WHO THREATEN US WHILE
SUPPORTING PARTNERS ON THE FRONTLINES IS ONE THAT WE HAVE
SUCCESSFULLY PURSUED IN YEMENAND SOMALIA FOR YEARS.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
WANT TO CITE A SUCCESSFULANTI-TERRORIST STRATEGY THAT WE
HAVE BEEN PURSUING -- FOR YEARS!
(LAUGHTER)IT'S LIKE PEPE LE PEW CITING
HIS SUCCESSFUL SEDUCTIONSTRATEGY OF RELENTLESS
UNCONSUMMATED CAT STALKING. SOWHAT HAS CAUSED THE
PRESIDENT TO CITE THE SUCCESSOF HIS CONTAINMENT STRATEGY IN
SOMALIA AND YEMEN AS EVIDENCE TOSUPPPORT HIS NEW DEGRADE AND
DESTROY STRATEGY AGAINST ISIS?
>> ACCORDING TO A RECENT POLL,91% OF THOSE ASKED BELIEVED THE
ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IS A THREATTO THE UNITED STATES.
>> 65% SUPPORT AIRSTRIKESIN SYRIA.
>> Jon: 65% SUPPORTAIRSTRIKES IN SYRIA.
AND HERE'S A CUTE FACT. THAT'S AFULL 15 PERCENTAGE POINTS
MORE THAN THE PERCENTAGE OFAMERICANS WHO CAN CORRECTLY
IDENTIFY SYRIA ON A MAP.
(APPLAUSE)OH, ISN'T THAT NICE?
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?(BLEEP) IT.
IF I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS,IT'S PROBABLY NOT WORTH KEEPING.
(LAUGHTER)IF THAT COUNTRY WAS SO GREAT,
WOULDN'T I BE ABLE TO POINT TOIT?
C'MON!
(LAUGHTER)SO IT SEEMS PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS
SURRENDERED, WHICH MEANS WE'REGOING TO WAR.
BUT ISIS ISN'T JUST OUR PROBLEM,IT'S THE WORLD'S PROBLEM,
SO WHO'S WITH US?
>> THE CORE COALITION OF TENCOUNTRIES
INCLUDING CANADA, BRITAIN,FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, POLAND,
DENMARK AND AUSTRALIA.
>> Jon: I'M GOING TO NEED TOSEE THIS ON THE BIG BOARD.
AHHH! OKAY.
THAT LOOKS AWFUL CHRISTIAN-Y.
IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF ACRUSADE-Y VIBE.
I HESTITATE TO ASK THIS, BUT CANA BROTHER GET AN OTTOMAN UP IN
THIS BITCH?
>> BUT ONLY OFFICIALLY INCLUDESONE MUSLIM NATION, TURKEY.
>> Jon: YES! WE ONLY NEEDEDONE, BABY! COVER SUPPLIED.
>> ANY SUGGESTION THAT TURKEY ISWELL ON BOARD FOR ANY SORT OF
MILITARY ACTION MAY BE APROBLEM FOR TURKEY.
>> Jon: BYE TURKEY. WE CAN'TGO TO WAR AGAINST A
MUSLIM GROUP WITHOUT A MUSLIMALLY.
NOW WE'RE JUST THE GROUP OFGROWN MEN AT THE ONE DIRECTION
CONCERT WITHOUT ANY KIDS. IMEAN, WE'RE THERE FOR THE RIGHT
REASON, WE LOVE THE MUSIC, BUTTHAT'S NOT WHAT EVERYONE ELSE
THINKS. EVERYONE ELSE THINKSCREEP ALERT. BOOP BOOP.
YOU KNOW, I AM SEEING KIND OF ALARGE NOT LIT UP
AREA IN THE REGION RIGHTAROUND WHERE I
GUESS YOU WOULD CALL WHERE THEPROBLEM IS.
CAN WE NOT GET SOME PARTNERSFROM THOSE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES, A
GROUP OF THEM, PERHAPS A KINDOF A MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD
FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD?
>> IRAN IS AT PRESENT THE ONLYREGIONAL COUNTRY HERE THAT HAS
ACTUALLY BEEN ACTIVE IN HELPINGTHE IRAQI MILITARY AND
GOVERNMENT ON THE GROUND.
>> Jon: IRAN.
THAT'S ALL WE GOT, IRAN.
THE COUNTRY WHOSE MAIN FUELSOURCE IS STILL THE BURNING OF
OUR FLAGS. IRAN, THAT IRAN.
AND OBVIOUSLY THEIR HUGEFIELDS OF OIL.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT APPEARS TO METHAT TO ATTACK SUNNI EXTREMISTS
BY JOINING THE WESTERN WORLDWITH THE BIG DOG OF THE
SHIITE WORLD MIGHT BE LITTLEWEIRD.
AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, INTHIS AREA OF NOTHING HAPPENING
AND NOBODY JOINING, THE UNITEDSTATES HAS SUPPLIED THAT AREA
WITH BILLIONS IN WEAPONSTECHNOLOGY AND MILITARY TRAINING
-- SO, FELLERS --
>> THERE IS AN AGREEMENT FROM
THE SAUDIS TODAY THAT THEY WILLCREATE BASES OR PERMIT THE FREE
SYRIAN ARMY TO TRAIN ANDAMERICANS WILL BE TRAINING THEM.
>> Jon: OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH!
SO WHILE AMERICA FIGHTS THEGROUP THAT WANTS TO TAKE THE
SAUDIS DOWN, THE SAUDIS ARELETTING US CRASH ON THEIR COUCH!
THANKS!
THANKS FOR MAKING YOURSELFAVAILABLE ON AIRSTRIKE BNB.
OH, YOU'RE SO GREAT!
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
ONCE AGAIN -- SAUDIS!(APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: ONCE AGAIN, IN OUREXCITEMENT TO EXPORT AMERICAN
BOOMOCRACY, WE MAY BE FORGETINGA VERY IMPORTANT LESSON.
>> WE CAN'T ERASE EVERY TRACE OFEVIL FROM THE WORLD.
>> Jon: DON'T TELL ME!
TELL YOU!
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE AN ANNIVERSARYTODAY. THE ATTACK OF 13 YEARS
AGO TODAY WAS PLANNED BY FOURDICKHEADS IN A THREE-BEDROOM
APARTMENT IN HAMBURG. PROBABLYCOULD HAVE BEEN A TWO-BEDROOM,
BUT THEY WANTED A HOME OFFICE.
THERE IS NO WAY TO MILITARILYELLIMINATE ENOUGH SPACE TO
KEEP SOME TERRORISTS FROMOPERATING AGAINST US.
SO UNTIL THIS PART OF THE WORLDDECIDES THAT IT IRKS THEM THAT
THE BELIEF SYSTEM THEY HOLDSACRED IS MISREPRESENTED TO
JUSTIFY A PERPETUAL VIOLENCEMACHINE, UNTIL IT STARTS TO SEE
PAST SECTARIAN LINES ANDNATIONAL BORDERS THAT -- OKAY,
WE DREW, WE'LL GIVE YOU THAT --THE UNITED STATES CAN'T FIX IT
BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE FIXED BYWAVING A MAGIC BOMB -- NOT THAT
WE DON'T HAVE ONE OF THOSE INDEVELOPMENT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
