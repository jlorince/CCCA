>> Jon: MY GUEST TONIGHT
SERVES IN THE PRESIDENT'S
CABINET AS SECRETARY OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN
SERVICES.
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE
PROGRAM SECRETARY KATHLEEN
SEBELIUS.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING
HERE.
>> GLAD TO BE HERE.
>> Jon: THANK YOU FOR BEING
HERE.
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN
OPPORTUNITY.
IN THE TIME THAT WE ARE
ALLOTTED TO BEGIN, IF YOU
COULD, TELL US HOW AGAINST ALL
ODDS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
OF AMERICAN OBAMAS HAS SAVED
AMERICA.
GO.
>> WELL, TWO-AND-A-HALF
MILLION YOUNG AMERICANS NOW
HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE WHO
DIDN'T HAVE IT BEFORE.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: THAT SEEMS LIKE A VERY
GOOD THING.
>> THAT'S VERY GOOD.
WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY WHO
ACTUALLY MAY BE IN LIFE-SAVING
SITUATIONS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH-
RISK POOLS, PEOPLE WHO BECAUSE
OF THEIR MEDICAL CONDITION
ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT GET
COVERED.
I'VE MET A COUPLE OF TIME.รงรณ
GAIL IN NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS
TREATMENT NOW FOR HER CANCER
THAT SHE ABSOLUTELY DIDN'T
HAVE AND WAS DENIED.
>> Jon: WHEN DOES THE BIG
STUFF KICK IN?
THE WHOLE DEAL?
>> THE WHOLE PROGRAM WILL BE
LIVE COME 2014, BUT PIECES OF
THE PROGRAM ARE....
>> Jon: COMING LIVE.
>> YOU BET.
>> Jon: IS THE HEALTH CARE
PROGRAM MTV, KATHLEEN?
WE'LL BE LIVE ON NEW YEAR'S
EVE.
>> WE HOPE PEOPLE START TUNING
IN TO HAVE FIND OUT WHAT THEY
HAVE.
HEALTHCARE DOT-GOV.
>> Jon: IT'S GOING TO BE
HOPPING TONIGHT.
>> WE HOPE SO.
>> Jon: I WAS CONFUSED, IT
SEEMED LIKE YOU HAVE ASKED THE
STATES NOW TO SET THE
BENCHMARKS?
OR IS THAT INCORRECT?
ORIGINALLY I THOUGHT THAT YOU
THE SECRETARY, THE ORIGINAL
BILL, WOULD SET THE BENCHMARKS
FOR WHAT THE INSURANCE PLAN
WOULD INCLUDE.
NOW IT SEEMS THAT THEY'RE
SAYING, WELL, NO, ACTUALLY THE
STATES WILL DO IT.
>> ACTUALLY IT'S A
COMBINATION.
CONGRESS IN THE LAW SAID AN
ESSENTIAL HEALTH PLAN HAS TO
HAVE TEN CATEGORIES.
FOR THE FIRST TIME
COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE.
IT HAS TO COVER MATERNITY CARE,
60% OF THE PLANS SOLD TO
INDIVIDUALS DON'T HAVE ANY
MATERNITY.
IT HAS TO COVER MENTAL HEALTH
TREATMENT.
ABOUT A THIRD OF THE FOLKS
DON'T HAVE SUBSTANCE
TREATMENT.
IT HAS TO COVER PRESCRIPTION
DRUGS.
THE TEN CATEGORIES LAID OUT.
WHAT WE SAID TO GET IT UP AND
RUNNING A STATE-BASED EXCHANGE
SHOULD HAVE THOSE TEN
CATEGORIES AND THEN THE STATE
CAN LOOK TO THEIR MOST POPULAR
SMALL BUSINESS PLAN, A FEDERAL
EMPLOYEE PLAN IN THAT AREA, A
STATE EMPLOYEE PLAN, TO CHOOSE
A PLAN THAT'S ALREADY MARKETED
UP AND RUNNING AND USE THAT AS
THE BENCHMARK PLAN FOR NEW
JERSEY.
>> Jon: NOW WHY WOULD YOU DO
THAT?
>> WELL, IT'S BECAUSE THE
FLEXIBILITY SHOULD BE AT THE
STATE LEVEL.
I'M A FORMER GOVERNOR.
A FORMER INSURANCE
COMMISSIONER.
INSURANCE MARKETS ARE
DIFFERENT.
WE WANT TO GIVE STATES WITHIN
A FRAMEWORK THE SAME WAY WE
DID WITH CHILDREN'S HEALTH
INSURANCE.
>> Jon: SECRETARY SEBELIUS.
>> YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT
OVER?
I'M NOT GOING TO.
>> Jon: THIS IS NOT HOW THE
RUSSIANS WOULD DO IT.
>> THAT IS TRUE.
>> Jon: WHAT'S SURPRISING IS I
THOUGHT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY
THE PRESIDENT AND YOU WERE
AGAINST ALLOWING PEOPLE TO
SHOP INTER-STATE PLANS LIKE TO
BUY A PLAN IN ANOTHER STATE
WAS THAT CERTAIN STATES, THE
REGULATIONS WERE NOT
CONSISTENT.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
>> Jon: IT WOULD BE LIKE
CREDIT CARDS.
>> THAT'S TRUE.
THERE ARE SOME STATES WHO ARE
VIRTUALLY NO CONSUMER
PROTECTIONS AND OTHER STATES
WHO HAD STRONG CONSUMER
PROTECTIONS.
THIS WILL BE... WE WILL SET
THE FRAMEWORK.
EVERY STATE NOW HAS INSURANCE
OVERSIGHT.
EVERY STATE WILL HAVE CONSUMER
PROTECTIONS.
WE WILL SORT OF BE THE....
>> Jon: I WAS UNDER THE
IMPRESSION THAT ABOUT HALF THE
STATES HAD THE ABILITY TO HAVE
INSURANCE OVERSIGHT AND ABOUT
HALF OF THEM DID NOT.
>> A BUNCH OF THEM NOW HAVE
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE
FINANCING STREAM FROM THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, ARE
PUTTING NEW REGULATIONS IN
PLACE.
WE NOW HAVE AN EXTRA
OVERSIGHT.
SO EVERYONE DOESN'T HAVE THE
FULL AUTHORITY YET.
WE HOPE THEY'LL GET IT SOON.
>> Jon: DO YOU HAVE THE
AUTHORITY?
HOW DO YOU KEEP LIKE... I'VE
NOTICED THAT PREMIUMS TEND TO
GO UP NOW.
>> YOU THINK?
YES, THEY DO.
(LAUGHING) I'M GLAD YOU'RE
NOTICING.
>> Jon: I'VE BEEN CONCERNED
ABOUT IT BECAUSE I LOVE
AMERICA.
>> YES.
I'M WITH YOU ON THAT.
>> Jon: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> BOTH OF US LOVE AMERICA.
>> Jon: WE REALLY DO.
YET IT'S NOT LEGAL FOR US TO
MARRY AMERICA.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
IF YOU GIVE THE OVERSIGHT TO
THE STATES THAT WE DIDN'T
THINK HAD THE ABILITY TO
REGULATE THEIR INSURANCE
COMPANIES ENOUGH TO LET US
SHOP THERE, WHY DO WE THINK
THAT THEY'LL HAVE THE ABILITY
TO REGULATE IT ENOUGH TO
CREATE REASONABLE PLANS FOR
PEOPLE?
WON'T THAT PUT THOSE STATES AT
A DISADVANTAGE?
>> THEY'RE KIND OF TWO
DIFFERENT THINGS.
FIRST OF ALL, THERE WILL BE
GROUND RULES FOR ALL INSURANCE
COMPANIES.
NEWS THAT'S ALREADY NOW BEING
CALCULATED.
THE NEW 80/20 RULE SAYS THAT
EVERY COMPANY, EVERY PLAN HAS
TO SPEND 80 CENTS OUT OF EVERY
DOLLAR COLLECTED ON HEALTH
BENEFITS NOT ON CEO SALARIES,
NOT ON OVERHEAD.
WE'RE COLLECTING THAT DATA
THIS YEAR.
( APPLAUSE )
YES, VERY GOOD.
NEXT YEAR CONSUMERS....
>> Jon: HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
REALLY?
>> YES.
>> Jon: EXPLAIN TO US VERY
QUICKLY IF THEY CAN'T DO THAT
AND THEY DON'T WANT TO, THEY
GET A WAIVER.
>> NO, NO.
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE
ACTUALLY GOING TO START
SENDING CHECKS BACK TO
CONSUMERS.
WE'RE COLLECTING THE DATA THIS
YEAR IN 2012.
>> Jon: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
ENFORCE THAT?
>> WELL, BECAUSE WE....
>> Jon: DO YOU HAVE THE
ENFORCEMENT ABILITY?
>> WE DO.
IN THE LAW WE HAVE THE ABILITY
AND THEY'RE TURNING THEIR
DATA... WHAT THEY ASKED US TO
DO IN A NUMBER OF CASES IS
GIVE THEM A PASS.
WELL, WE'LL BE AT 60 CENTS TO
THE DOLLAR OR 70 CENTS TO THE
DOLLAR.
BY AND LARGE WE HAVE SAID NO.
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF
COMPANIES WHERE THE CONSUMERS
HAD NO OTHER CHOICE.
WE SAID YOU HAVE TON ON A
PATHWAY TO 80 CENTS.
WE'LL GIVE YOU AN EXTRA YEAR.
BASICALLY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
BE GETTING CHECKS ACROSS THIS
COUNTRY BACK.
>> Jon: IT IS, YOU KNOW, I'VE
STARTED READING ABOUT IT.
IT'S SO CONFUSING.
JUST AS YOU DESCRIBE IT AS A
PATHWAY TO 80 CENTS.
JUST SAYS TO ME WE NEED TO GET
YOU OUT ON WEEKENDS TO LIKE
MOVIES.
THEY'RE KILLING YOU DOWN THERE
IN WASHINGTON.
WILL YOU STICK AROUND FOR A
SECOND?
WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT IT.
WE'LL GO TO COMMERCIAL AND
THROW IT UP ON THE WEBB-E-WEBB.
YOU KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN
THERE?
IT CAN GET PIE RATED.
SECRETARY KATHLEEN SEBELIUS.
WE'LL COME RIGHT BACK AND
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.
