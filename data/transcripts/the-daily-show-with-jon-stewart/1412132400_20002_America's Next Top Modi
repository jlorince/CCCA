THE WOODEN POLITICANSPONTIFICATING TO APATHETIC,
HALF-FILLED ROOMS. -- ITWAS REALLY WAIT, WHAT?
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?

SUPERSTAR RECEPTION AS HEADDRESSED A SELLOUT CROWD AT NEW
YORK'S MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.
>>  20,000 MEMBERS OF THEINDIAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY TURNED
OUT.

NO WORLD LEADER HAS DRAWN THATMANY AMERICANS FOR ANYTHING!
EXCEPT MAYBE ONE OF YOURBERLUSCONI BUNGA BUNGA PARTIES.

MINISTER MODI.

BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIANAMERICANS WHO WERE
MAD FOR MODI. EVERYONE WANTED APIECE OF THE NEW STAR,
HILLARY CLINTON, BILLDE BLASIO, CHRIS CHRISTIE,
CEOS FROM G.E., I.B.M., GOLDMANSACHS, EVEN THE
BIG DOG HIMSELF WHO I CAN ONLYASSUME TURNED TO MODI AND SAID,
MUST BE NICE TO STILL HAVE THATNEW LEADER SMELL!

DON'T GIVE YOUR PEOPLEHEALTH INSURANCE
BECAUSE IT JUST (BLEEP) YOU INTHE END!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)BUT YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS
THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'TTAKE TO MODI NEARLY AS MUCH AS
THE REPUBLICANS WHO WERE TOTALLYWON OVER BY MODI'S
PRO-BUSINESS MESSAGE.
>> PRIME MINISTER MODI HAS FAREXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS.
>> IT WAS A VERY POWERFULSPEECH.
I THOUGHT IT ELECTRIFIED THEAUDIENCE HERE.

BECOME THE NEXT RONALD REAGANFOR THE WORLD.
>> Jon: THE NEXT RONALDREAGAN -- BLESSED BE THY NAME --
(LAUGHTER)THAT'S A SACRED HONOR USUALLY
ONLY RESERVED FOR AIRPORTS ANDPOST OFFICES.
CAN MODI LIVE UP TOTHE NAME?
>> SOME SUGGEST THAT THE ADORINGCROWDS IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
WERE REPRESENTATIVE OF INDIA'SWEALTHY AND NOT INDIA'S POOR
MAJORITY, WHO THEY SAY WEREBEING HARMED BY MODI'S
POLICIES OF DEREGULATIONAND PRIVATIZATION.
>> THEY ALSO SAY THAT HISECONOMIC CREDENTIALS AND
POLICIES ARE ONLY HELPINGTHE 1%, THE RICH.
>> Jon: HE IS THE NEW RAEGAN.
(APPLAUSE)BUT, OF COURSE, REAGAN WAS
KNOWN AS THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR,RAEGAN WAS A
GREAT COMMUNICATOR, SOMETHINGMODI WILL HAVE TO LIVE UP TO.
AND ON SATURDAY, MODI SPOKE ATCENTRAL PARK.
WHERE HE HAD A CHANCE TO PROVEHIS REAGANISMS AS A MAN WHO CAN
SPEAK TO ALL CULTURES AND ALLPEOPLES. MISTER PRIME MINISTER,
SHARE YOUR WORDS IN WAYS WEAMERICANS CAN UNDERSTAND.
