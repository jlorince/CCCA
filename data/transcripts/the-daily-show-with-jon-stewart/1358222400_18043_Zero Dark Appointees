ALL RIGHT.
OF COURSE THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ISSUE FACING OBAMA.
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PICKS FOR HIS NEW CABINET MEMBERS RAISING SOME QUESTIONS.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HIS FOUR NEWEST CHOICES.
ONE THING YOU MIGHT NOTICE ABOUT ALL OF THEM, ANYBODY WANT TO JUMP IN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
>> Jon: THAT'S KISS WITHOUT THE MAKE-UP.
I KNOW THESE GUYS.
YES!
PLAY "LICK IT UP."
>> WHERE ARE THE WOMEN, FOR EXAMPLE?
WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE OF COLOR?
THE FOURTH WHITE MALE MR. OBAMA HAS CHOSEN IN THE LAST MONTH
>> WHERE ARE THE WOMEN?
WHERE ARE THE MINORS
>> Jon: YOU'RE TELLING ME THE PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES COULDN'T HAVE
FOUND ONE WOMAN OR MINORITY TO FILL AN IMPORTANT JOB?
WHAT ABOUT INSTEAD OF JOHN KERRY SUSAN RICE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE.
LADY AND MINORITY.
TRIPLE WORD SCORE
>> I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO BLOCK HER.
SHE'S NOT QUALIFIED.
>> Jon: OH, RIGHT.
McCAIN.
DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT BARACK OBAMA HIMSELF IS SOMEWHAT DIVERSE IS BEING DISCRIMINATORY
IN HIS HIRING PRACTICES
>> THE "NEW YORK TIMES" RAN THIS PHOTO THE OTHER DAY SHOWING THE PRESIDENT WITH A GROUP OF ALL
WHITE MEN ADVISING HIM IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
>> Jon: FIRST OF ALL COMPUTER ENHANCED.
THERE'S A BLACK GUY RIGHT THERE.
NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT BALANCES EVERYTHING OUT BUT THAT IS A BLACK GUY.
AND THERE IS ANOTHER BLACK GUY WHO APPEARS TO BE RUNNING THE MEETING.
STILL, FAIR POINT.
THERE AREN'T ANY WOMEN IN THE PHOTO.
>> THIS PHOTO SHOWS THE PRESIDENT SURROUNDED BY ALL MALE ADVISORS ALTHOUGH THE WHITE
HOUSE SAYS TOP AIDE VALERIE JARRETT IS HIDDEN BEHIND THE MEN.
>> Jon: THAT'S JUST VALERIE JARRETT'S STYLE.
HERE SHE IS AT THE '08 INAUGURATION.
HERE SHE IS AT TIANAMEN SQUARE.
HERE SHE IS WITH BUZZ ALDRIN ON THE MOON.
SHE'S LIKE A LIVING WHERE'S WALDO.
HERE SHE IS BEHIND WALDO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT'S EXCUSE FOR THIS.
ACTUALLY, I CAN HEAR THE PRESIDENT'S EXCUSE FOR THIS
>> I'M VERY PROUD THAT IN THE FIRST FOUR YEARS THAT WE HAD AS DIVERSE IF NOT MORE DIVERSE A
WHITE HOUSE AND A CABINET THAN ANY IN HISTORY.
WHAT?
I'VE MADE FOUR APPOINTMENTS SO FAR.
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT EVERYBODY KIND OF WAIT UNTIL THEY'VE SEEN ALL MY APPOINTMENTS, WHO IS IN
THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF AND WHO IS IN MY CABINET BEFORE THEY RUSH TO JUDGMENT.
>> Jon: FOR MORE WE'RE JOINED BY SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JESSICA WILLIAMS.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) JESSICA, ALL LAST YEAR THE CONCERN ABOUT OBAMA IN HIS
SECOND TERM WAS GOING TO BE THAT HE'S GOING TO GO FULL ON LIKE SOCIALIST BLACK PANTHER ONE
WORLD GOVERNMENT.
NOW HE APPEARS TO HAVE GONE MORE SEASON ONE OF MAD MEN.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
>> JOHN, PEOPLE FORGET, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS ALSO HALF WHITE.
EVERYBODY WAS WAS SO FOCUSED ON BLACK OBAMA AND ALL THE BLACK STUFF HE DID IN HIS FIRST TERM.
OBAMA CARE, FOOD STAMP.
THEY COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT WHITE OBAMA WHO HAS BEEN IN THERE BIDING HIS TIME.
JUST WAITING TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK AND RESTORE THE TRADITIONAL AMERICA THIS BLACK
OBAMA HAS WORKED SO HARD TO DESTROY.
>> Jon: WOW.
EXACTLY Jon: I GOT SO SAY, WHITE OBAMA HAS BEEN PLAYING A LONG GAME
>> JON, YOU KNOW, WHITE OBAMA HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE MAKING THE OCCASIONAL APPEARANCE.
ON VACATION.
ON WEEKENDS.
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CATCH A BROTHER WEARING THOSE JEANS AND A BIKE HELMET ON A TEN
SPEED WITH CROSS TRAINERS ON.
>> Jon: THAT WHITE OBAMA IS PRETTY WHITE.
>> THE WHITEST.
Jon: SO IF WHITE OBAMA IS 50% AND BLACK OBAMA IS 50%...
>> WELL HE'S NOT QUITE LIKE THAT, OKAY.
ACCORDING TO THE WHITE OBAMA, BLACK OBAMA IS ONLY 47% OF TOTAL OBAMA.
>> Jon: WHAT?
YEAH.
HE SAYS THAT 47% FEELS IT'S ENTITLED TO SOMETHING FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
>> Jon: WHAT'S THE OTHER 3%?
WHITE OBAMA IS PRETTY SURE IT'S LATINO.
>> Jon: WHAT?
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
>> WHITE OBAMA DOESN'T KNOW.
IF WE DON'T PUT A STOP TO IT, THE PRESIDENT WILL BE ALMOST ALL LATINO BY 2020.
>> Jon: OH, MY GOD.
SO WHITE OBAMA IS IN CHARGE NOW?
>> YEP.
HE'S GOING TO RETURN THIS COUNTRY TO THE GREATNESS OF THE FOUNDERS.
WITH A CABINET OF WHITE GUYS.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
Jon: IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.
I KNOW.
I HEAR YOU.
>> GET IT OUT.
Jon: KNOCK IT RIGHT NOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
JESSICA WILLIAMS, EVERYBODY, AT
