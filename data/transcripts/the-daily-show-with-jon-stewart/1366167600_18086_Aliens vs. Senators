PRETTY GOOD.
WHY DON'T WE DEAL WITH SOME
NON-AWFUL NEWS?
IT APPEARS WE MAY BE ON THE CUSP
OF A BREAK THROUGH ON
IMMIGRATION REFORM.
>> THE BIPARTISAN SENATE GANG OF
EIGHT IS SOON EXPECTED TO
RELEASE AN IMMIGRATION BLUEPRINT
THAT WILL INCLUDE A PATH TO
CITIZENSHIP.
>> Jon: REALLY?
"GANG?"
REALLY?
FIRST OF ALL.
THAT'S A GANG OF EIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT LITTLE GROUP THERE.
YOU'RE GOING TO CALL THEM A
GANG?
I THINK YOU MEAN THE CO-OP BOARD
OF EIGHT.
(LAUGHTER)
THAT IS NOT A GANG.
HOW IS THAT A GANG?
"I GET A TEARDROP TATTOO FOR
EACH APARTMENT APPLICATION I
REJECT."
(LAUGHTER)
"THIS TATTOO RIGHT HERE, THE
WOMAN HAD A DOG."
(LAUGHTER)
BUT A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP IS
GOOD NEWS SEEING AS THIS IS THE
CURRENT PATH.
(AUDIENCE REACTS)
SO ANY PATH IS BETTER THAN THIS.
ON SUNDAY GANG OF EIGHT MEMBER
CAPTAIN THIRSTY, A.K.A. NO-SPIT
JOHNSON, A.K.A. THE HUMAN
DESSICANT, A.K.A. THE GEL PACKET
THEY PUT IN CLOTHES SO THEY
DON'T RETAIN MOISTURE, RUBIO
LAID OUT THE PATH.
>> YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A
FINE, AN APPLICATION FEE, YOU
HAVE TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK.
>> Jon: (LAUGHS)
BACKGROUND CHECK THAT'S EASY TO
GET AROUND, BACKGROUND CHECK.
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TELL
IMMIGRATION YOU'RE A GUN.
(LAUGHTER)
STILL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO
BAD.
YOU GET A FEW FEES, A FEW FORMS
THEN YOU'RE A CITIZEN, RIGHT?
>> ASSUMING ALL THAT HAPPENS THE
ONLY THING YOU GET IS A WORK
PERMIT.
>> Jon: OH.
WELL, THAT'S KIND OF A LOT OF
WORK JUST TO BE ALLOWED TO DO
OUR (BLEEP)EST WORK.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S ALL WORTH IT WHEN YOU GET
TO PARTAKE IN THE AMERICAN
DREAM.
>> YOU DON'T QUALIFY FOR ANY
FEDERAL BENEFITS AND YOU HAVE TO
PROVE THAT YOU CAN SUSTAIN AND
SUPPORT YOURSELF AND YOU HAVE TO
BE IN THE SYSTEM AT LEAST TEN
YEARS BEFORE WE GIVE YOU ACCESS
TO APPLY FOR THE LEGAL
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: OKAY, NOW THAT'S
STARTING TO SOUND LIKE A LOT.
ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE SAME SYSTEM
THEY HAVE A PLACE TO GET "BOOK
OF MORMON" TICKETS.
(APPLAUSE)
GOOD SHOW.
AND I'M FRIENDS WITH THOSE GUYS!
ALL RIGHT, SO THIS NEW PATH TO
CITIZENSHIP IT'S ABOUT STAMINA.
IT'S LONG, IT'S ARDUOUS, BUT
IT'S POSSIBLE.
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING OUT
OF THESE INDIVIDUALS' CONTROL
THAT WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN BEFORE
THEY CAN WALK DOWN THIS POSSIBLE
PATH TO CITIZENSHIP?
>> YOU DON'T GAIN ACCESS TO ANY
OF THAT UNTIL THERE'S A
UNIVERSALLY VERIFIED SYSTEM IN
PLACE.
>> THAT WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO
CHECK THE CITIZENSHIP STATUS OF
WORKERS THEY WANT TO HIRE.
>> Jon: THAT WILL NEVER
HAPPEN.
(LAUGHTER)
WE STILL COME UP WITH A COMPUTER
PROGRAM LIKE THAT FOR VETERANS
MEDICAL RECORDS AND WE LIKE
VETERANS!
(LAUGHTER)
WHAT ELSE HAS TO HAPPEN?
>> ANOTHER IS A TRACKING SYSTEM
TO MAKE SURE THAT IMMIGRANTS WHO
COME INTO THE COUNTRY LEGALLY
DON'T END UP OVERSTAYING THEIR
VISAS.
>> Jon: NO PATH TO CITIZENSHIP
UNTIL "LOGAN'S RUN" IS A
REALITY.
(LAUGHTER)
WOW, I AM OLD.
REALLY?
NO "LOGAN'S RUN" FANS?
REMEMBER "YOU'RE GOING TO
CAROUSEL" AND THEN THE PEOPLE
AND FARRAH FAWCETT WOULD --
(LAUGHTER).
OR NOT!
I'M JUST GONNA GET SOME MILK.
(LAUGHTER)
THEN THERE WAS THE FRANCHISE
CALLED "STAR WARS".
(LAUGHTER)
AND LASTLY --
>> AND LASTLY THERE WOULD BE
WHAT HE CALLED REAL BORDER
SECURITY WHICH WOULD INCLUDE
FENCING.
>> Jon: FENCING?
FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOU REALLY THINK
THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO KEEP
IMMIGRANTS OUT?
(LAUGHTER AND APPL
