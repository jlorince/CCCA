>> John: JON STEWART IS STILL
NOT HERE.
HE'S ACTUALLY UPSTATE IN THE KIT
SKILLS.
THE OUR GUEST TONIGHT IS FROM
THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN
RELATIONS.
RICHARD HAASS WILL BE WITH US.
BEFORE WE GET STARTED LAST NIGHT
JUST BEFORE WE WENT ON AIR, THE
ROYAL BABY WAS BORN.
SO WE TURN OUR COVERAGE TONIGHT
JUST BEFORE SHOW TIME THERE WAS
BREAKING NEWS ABOUT ANTHONY WEAN
SER... WEINER.
SO WE WILL COVER ANTHONY
WEINER'S TOMORROW WHICH SPOILER
ALERT IS DOING A LOT MORE THAN
ANTHONY WEINER HAS BEEN DOING.
FOR NOW, ROLL IT.
(TRUMPET FANFARE).
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT WAS A BOY.
AND FINALLY WE HAVE A MEMBER OF
THE ROYAL FAMILY WITH AN ACTUAL
EXCUSE FOR BEING A TOOTHLESS,
PET LUNT, USELESS HUMAN BEING.
THAT WILL GET ME IN TROUBLE BACK
HOME.
THIS BOY CAME INTO THE WORLD
WITH SO MUCH POMP AND
CIRCUMSTANCE IT'S HARD TO...
>> WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOW
BEING PUT ON THE EASEL.
IN FACT, IT IS THERE.
IT IS NOW BEING CHAINED IN TO
THE FAMOUS GOLDEN EASEL AT
BUCKINGHAM PALACE.
>> THE GOLDEN EASEL.
DON'T LOOK DIRECTLY AT IT.
YOU'LL MAKE IT DIRTY WITH YOUR
PEASANT EYES.
INCIDENTALLY THAT EASEL IS
TRADITIONALLY USED.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SOME FOUND OUT BY EASEL AND
OTHERS IN THIS WAY.
(INAUDIBLE) GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!
>> John: OKAY.
I'M ENGLISH AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT MAN JUST YELLED.
IS THAT HOW THE QUEEN FOUND OUT?
PRESSING HER FACE UP AGAINST THE
WINDOW AND HEARING (YELLING) A
BABY!
>> WILLIAM IS HOLDING HIS NEW
CHILD IN HIS ARMS.
HE WILL PHONE THE QUEEN AND SAY,
HELLO, GRANNY, IT'S A BABY.
>> John: IT'S A BABY.
THAT GENUINELY IS WORTH
MENTIONING.
JUST HOW INBRED IS THIS FAMILY?
REALLY?
YOU KNOW, YOUR GREAT AUNT GAVE
BIRTH TO SOMETHING ELSE.
OF COURSE, HOW COULD ANYTHING
INVOLVING THE QUEEN...
>> THE QUEEN LIKES TO GO TO BED
AROUND 9:00 P.M. U.K. TIME.
>> WE'RE A LITTLE NERVOUS AS
NIGHT WAS APPROACHING BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T ROUSE THE QUEEN AFTER
10:30 OR SO AT NIGHT.
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT.
OH, THAT IS TRUE.
IF THAT BABY HADN'T COME OUT
BEFORE 9:00 HE WAS GOING TO BE
PUSHED BACK IN.
YOU DID NOT DISTURB HER MAJESTY.
NOW, THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE
QUEEN WASN'T INTIMATELY INVOLVED
IN BIRTHING PROCESS.
>> THE QUEEN'S GYNECOLOGIST HAS
BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THIS
PREGNANCY AND LABOR.
>> John: AS A SOCIETY WE WILL
NEVER SPEAK ALLOWED OR EVEN
THINK THE PHRASE "THE QUEEN'S
GYNECOLOGIST" EVER AGAIN.
ONCE THE WORD AND THE BABY WERE
OUT, IT WAS SHOW TIME.
THERE WERE CANNONS.
THERE WAS THE TRADITIONAL DAVID
BECKHAM WELCOME.
AS IS THE CASE WITH ALL THE
ROYAL OCCASIONS THE SONG WITH
ELTON JOHN THIS TIME DRESSED AS
A BABY AND SINGING "I JUST CAN'T
WAIT TO BE KING."
BRITAIN CELEBRATED IN ITS
TRADITIONAL WAY: BY DRINKING.
>> BUCKLEBERRY WHERE KATE'S
PARENTS LIVE.
>> KATE AND WILLIAM,...
John: I'M SORRY.
CAN WE STOP IT RIGHT THERE.
GO BACK A BIT.
WAS THERE A HORSE IN THAT BAR?
YES!
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THERE'S AN ACTUAL HORSE.
NOT ONLY WAS THERE A HORSE.
BUT IT WAS WATCHING TELEVISION
WITH EVERYONE ELSE.
THAT IS THE SINGLE GREATEST
THING ON THE PLANET.
NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THERE'S A
HORSE IN THERE BUT BECAUSE THAT
HORSE IS CLEARLY THERE SO OFTEN.
IT'S NOT THE LEAST BIT
SURPRISING.
YOU GET THE SENSE THAT IF THIS
HORSE WALKED IN AND THE
BARTENDER SAID, "WHY THE LONG
FACE," THE HORSE WOULD SAY," I
HAD A ROUGH DAY AT WORK.
NOW GIVE ME A BOTTLE OF
