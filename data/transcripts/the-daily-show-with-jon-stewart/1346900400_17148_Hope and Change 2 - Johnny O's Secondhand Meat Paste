(BLEEP).
(LAUGHTER) FOR MORE, OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT JOHN OLIVER.
JOHN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) WHAT A NIGHT.
A LOT OF STORY TELLING BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY OBAMA'S ACTIONS.
>> Jon:ACTIONS..
>> AND THEY'RE NOT ALONE, JON,
I, TOO, HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY THIS PRESIDENT IN A PERSONAL WAY.
>> Jon: JON, IS THAT AN IMMIGRATION RELATED ISSUE?
>> NO, IT ISN'T, BAD GUESS.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
(LAUGHTER) JON, LAST YEAR WHILE COVERING A WHITE HOUSE PERES BRIEFING I CHOKED ON A HOT DOG.
(LAUGHTER) AS I FELT MY LIFE SLIPPING FROM ME SUDDENLY THERE WAS PRESIDENT
BARACK OBAMA LEAPING OVER THE ROSE BUSHES TO CATCH ME BEFORE I HIT THE GROUND!
CRADLING MY HEAD GENTLY UPON HIS LAP JUST LIKE THAT HE THRUST HIS OWN FINGERS DOWN MY THROAT JUST
SO, YANKED THE OBSTRUCTION CLEAR AND THEN AS SWEET OXYGEN FILLED MY LUNGS ONCE AGAIN HE SAID THE
WORDS THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET.
"CAN WE GET THIS MAN ANOTHER HOT DOG?" (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> Jon: REALLY.
>> YES.
YES.
>> Jon: HE SAID YOU CAN HAVE ANOTHER HOT DOG?
>> YES, HE DID.
>> Jon: YOU HAD JUST CHOKED ON A HOT DOG!
>> EXACTLY, JON, BUT PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULDN'T LET ME GIVE UP!
(LAUGHTER) AND THAT IS WHY HE PERSONALLY CHEWED THAT HOT DOG FOR ME,
TENDERLY RETURPBLG TATING THE WARM MEAT PASTE INTO MY MOUTH LIKE A MOTHER BIRD.
JON, CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?
IT WAS THE GREATEST HOT DOG I'VE EVER TASTED.
(AUDIENCE REACTS) EVER.
AND IT GETS BETTER.
IT DIDN'T STOP THERE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA THEN HELPED ME OPEN UP MY OWN SMALL BUSINESS.
SELLING HIGH-QUALITY PREDIGESTED HOT DOGS AT REASONABLE PRICES,
JON.
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TRY SOME IF YOU HAVE TIME.
>> Jon: YOU... YOU BROUGHT SOME SAMPLES HERE.
>> KIND OF, RIGHT THERE...
(GAGGING).
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT'S OKAY.
BUT THE STORE I HAVE IS A LITTLE MUCH, DON'T YOU THINK?
IT'S ALL BEEN A LITTLE MUCH.
>> OF COURSE.
THEY ALL ARE.
BUT LOOK AT WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE UP AGAINST, JON.
LAST WEEK REPUBLICANS SPENT THEIR ENTIRE CONVENTION CONSTRUCTING A FICTIONAL OBAMA
AND ININVISIBLE CHAIR-BOUND TYRANT HELL-BENT ON DESTROYING AMERICA.
IT'S FRANKLY ONLY NATURAL THAT DEMOCRATS WOULD COUNTER WITH THEIR OWN MYTHICAL OBAMA-- STILL
INVISIBLE, BUT THIS TIME SITTING ON A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT CHAIR.
(LAUGHTER) OH, WHAT'S THAT, CHAIR?
WHAT'S THAT?
WELL, I CAN'T TELL JON TO GO DO THAT TO HIMSELF.
OKAY, CHAIR, IF YOU INN CYST.
JON, THE CHAIR SAYS GO (BLEEP) YOURSELF.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: THE CHAIR?
THANK YOU, JOHN OLIVER,
