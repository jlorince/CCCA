FOR THE NEWS MEDIA LATELY.
YOU GOT THE ABSENCE OF ANY NEWMISSING MALAYSIAN PLANES.
[LAUGHTER]CNN IS SO DESPERATE THEY
ACTUALLY COVERED SOME GUY WHOSAID HE FOUND THE SANTA MARIA.
[LAUGHTER]OF THE NINA, THE PINTA AND SANTA
MARIA FAME. APPARENTLY, CNN ISJUST GOING TO GO
BACK AND LOOKFOR LOST INCREASINGLY OLDER
FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION.
[LAUGHTER]UP NEXT ARCHEOLOGISTS DISCOVERED
A KIND OF FOOT-POWERED CAVE CAR.
MARTIN SAVAGE IS IN A CAVESIMULATOR RIGHT NOW.
IT'S BEEN TERRIBLE TIME FOR THENEWS MEDIA.

TAPE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO KEEPROLLING IT.
>> Jon: YOU HAVE TO WATCH ITBECAUSE WE'LL MAKE YOU WATCH IT.
LOOK AT IT. GAZE UPON IT. LOOKAT IT.
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT THEINTERNET WAS FOR, BUT OK.
WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE FIRSTFAMILY OF POP MUSIC TO TEAR
ITSELF ASUNDER IS THE SUBJECT OFTONIGHT'S
ROC NATION IN CRISIS,TROUBLE IN BEYADISE
NEWS POWERS ACTIVATE, FORM OFBASELESS SPECULATION!
>> SOLANGE RECENTLY LEFT ROCKNATION A YEAR AGO TO START HER
OWN RECORD LABEL SAINT RECORDS.
SO, IT COULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT ARECORD LABEL.
>> SURE, IT COULD BE AFUED ABOUT THAT.
YOU KNOW, SOME ARTISTS SUE THERECORD LABEL LIKE PRINCE.
OTHERS TRY AND KICK THEIR RECORDLABEL IN THE FACE.
[LAUGHTER]SO MAYBE THIS IS A BUSINESS
DEAL GONE WRONG, CLASSICKICK-FIGHT MOTIVATION.
>> IT'S A COMPLETERUMOR. AND THEY SAY
THAT SOMEHOW THERE'SSOME INFIDELITY INVOLVED.
>> WAS SOLANGE, DID SHE HAVESOMETHING TO DRINK? IS
THAT WHY SHE AT LEAST APPEARSTO HAVE A RATHER SHORT FUSE.
>> Jon: AH, INFIDELITY PLUSINSOBRIETY COMBINED WITH THE
POWERFUL G FORCES OF VERTICALDESCENT.
A DANGEROUS COCKTAIL.
>> HE APPARENTLY WANTED TO DITCHHER AND BEYONCE TO GO PARTY
WITH RIHANNA AFTER THE MET GALA.[CROWD CHEERING]
>> Jon: I WOULD TOTALLY DO THATTOO. TOTALLY PARTY WITH
RIHANNA. RIRI IS LIKE, SHE'S SOCOOL.
WITH ALL OF THESE INCREDIBLYWELL-SOURCED MOTIVES, I CAN'T
BELIEVE SOLANGE DIDN'T SPENDTHE ENTIRE MET BALL KICKING
JAY-Z IN THE FACE. WHY WAITTIL THE ELEVATOR?
PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO MOVE ONTO BASELESS SPECULATION TO
SPECULATION OF A MORE PERSONALNATURE.
>> I HAVE A SISTER THAT I FEELSO PROTECTIVE OF.
I THINK THIS IS A STORY OF ALITTLE SISTER STICKING UP FOR
HER SISTER.
>> THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER BEENFIRED UP, AND NOT LIKE THAT,
I MEAN I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT DOINGTHAT TO A MAN MY SISTER
USED TO BE MARRIEDTO BUT I DIDN'T.
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon:  APPARENTLY A LOT OF
THE NEWS MEDIA WAS IN A CLUBCALLED THE SISTERHOOD OF THE
TRAVELING KICK TO THE NUTS.
OF COURSE, THOSE WITHOUT SISTERSBUT WHO MAY HAVE THEIR OWN
PERSONAL DEMONS MIGHT HAVEVIEWED THIS STORY THROUGH A
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LENS.
>> HOW DOES TMZ GET ALL THISSTUFF, THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO
KNOW. >> THAT'S THE QUESTION.
IT'S THE ELEVATOR SECURITYSYSTEM IN THE HOTEL AND
THE HOTEL SAID THEY WERE GOINGTO FIRE ANYBODY WHO COULD FIND
IT, WHO LEAKED IT--
HOW IN THE WORLD DOES TMZ COMEUP WITH THIS?
[LAUGHTER]>> Jon: I MEAN, THEY DON'T
HAVE CAMERAS IN ALL THE ROOMS DOTHEY? I MEAN, IT'S NOT, I
MEAN, NOT THAT I'VE DONEANYTHING IN A HOTEL I WOULDN'T
WANT THE WORLD TO SEE. BUTWHAT ABOUT THE POOL?
DO THEY HAVE CAMERAS BY THEPOOL? I NEED TO CALL A LAWYER.
[LAUGHTER]BUT THEN SUDDENLY LIKE A HEALED
FOOT FLASHING THROUGH A FRAME,IT ALL CAME CRASHING DOWN.
>> I'VE GOT TO RAIN ON THEPARADE A LITTLE BIT HERE.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOWWHAT HAPPENED IN THE ELEVATOR
BUT WHAT'S MORE I DON'T CARE.>> WHAT?
I THINK THE CORE OF THIS STORYIS NOT REALLY A STORY.
>> Jon:  WE'VE GOT A CODE 9. WE'VE GOT A RUNNER.
SOMEONE HIT THE TRAP DOOR. WEGOT A RUNNER. CODE 9.
THE BABY IS IN THE WELL.
THE BABY IS IN THE WELL. [LAUGHTER]
I'M I'M, I HAVE LIKE A, IT'SLIKE A SPECIAL DEVICE WHERE I
TALK TO OTHER. BY THE WAY,THAT'S CHRISTOPHER JOHN FARLEY.
HE'S AN EDITOR AT THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL.
SO IT'S A PRINCE SITUATION.
HE'S BRINGING A WORD PROCESSORTO A VIDEO FIGHT.
>> I HAVE TO DISAGREEWITH YOU.
I THINK IT'S A STORY BECAUSE OFTHE INTEREST.
>> PEOPLE AREINTERESTED IN PORNOGRAPHY TOO
AND WE DON'T ALWAYS COVER THAT.
[CROWD CHEERING]>> Jon:  THAT'S TRUE.
AND, EVEN WHEN THE WALL STREETJOURNAL DOES COVER PORNOGRAPHY,
THEY DO IT WITH CLASS.
[LAUGHTER]CLASSIC POINTALLISM. COME ON,
MR. HIGH AND MIGHTY FOURTHESTATE, YOU CAN'T REALLY BELIEVE
THIS PRIVATE FAMILY QUARRELSTOLEN FROM AN IN-HOUSE
SURVEILLANCE FEEDISN'T NATIONAL NEWS.
>> I MEAN IT MATTERS WHAT'S ASTORY. DONALD STERLING'S A STORY
BECAUSE THERE'S RACISM INVOLVED.
>> BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THATIT'S NEWS WORTHY.
IT DOESN'T MEAN THATIT'S NEWSWORTHY.

>> CELEBRITIES IN AN ELEVATORFIGHTING.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN SUCH A THINGSINCE NBC'S HIT REALITY SHOW.

CERTAINLY BY THEENTERTAINMENT MEDIA.
