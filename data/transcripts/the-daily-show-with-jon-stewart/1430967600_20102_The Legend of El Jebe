(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)>> Jon: HEY, EVERYBODY,
WELCOME BACK.
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUTIMMIGRATION.
A HOT-BUTTON ISSUE, IN THE2008 AND 2012 ELECTION.
AND IN THE RACE FOR 2016, THATBUTTON IS ONLY GETTING HOTTER.
>> HILLARY CLINTON RETURNEDTO NEVADA.
TO REKINDLE HER RELATIONSHIPWITH HISPANIC VOTERS.
SHE DECLARED HERUNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT TO A
PATH FOR CITIZENSHIP FORILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
>> WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGERFOR A PATH TO FULL AND EQUAL
CITIZENSHIP.
>> Jon: SO I SAID IT, AM IPRESIDENT NOW OR WHAT?
ARE WE DONE HERE PEOPLE?
TICK TOCK, I'VE GOTMEETINGS.
WILL CLINTON'S BOLD IMMIGRATIONGAMBIT SWAY LATINO VOTERS?
FOR THE ANSWER, WE ARE JOINED BYSENIOR LATINO CORRESPONDENT
AL MADRIGAL. AL.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)NICE TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND.
THIS IS AMAZING, NO MAINSTREAMCANDIDATE HAS EVER OFFERED
NO EVER OFFERED THIS MUCH.
>> IT'S A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP,IT'S A SOLID OPENING OFFER.
NOT A BAD START EVEN IF HERHISTORIC IMMIGRATION SPEECH
WAS DELIVERED IN WHAT ISCLEARLY THE ADULT
CIRCULATION ROOM OF A PUBLICLIBRARY.
I GUESS SHE FIGURED HEY IF THISIS A GOOD ENOUGH PLACE FOR
HOMELESS GUYS TO MASTURBATEIN, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR
PANDERING TO LATINOS.
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: AND THEY THOUGHT PUBLIC
LIBRARIES WOULDN'T LAST INTHE INTERNET AGE.
BUT AL, YOU DON'T SEEMINSPIRED.
YOU DON'T SEEM -->> IT JUST FEELS LIKE WE'VE
BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE.
>> I ALSO BELIEVE WE HAVE TOGIVE A PATHWAY TO
CITIZENSHIP AFTER THEY HAVEPAID A FINE AND LEARNED
ENGLISH, TO THOSE WHO AREALREADY HERE.
>> AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY GET,MORE DEPORTATIONS THAN EVER
BEFORE.
WHAT I AM SAYING ISDEMOCRATS SHOULDN'T EXPECT
TO GET LATINO SUPPORT JUSTBECAUSE THEY SAY ALL THE RIGHT
THINGS.
ESPECIALLY SINCE REPUBLICANSFINALLY HAVE A CANDIDATE
LATINOS CAN CALL THEIR OWN.>> Jon: ACTUALLY TWO, IT'S TWO.
MARCO RUBIO AND TED CRUZ.
>> EH, I GUESS THOSE GUYSARE TECHNICALLY LATINOS.
I MEAN THERE IS A LOT MORETO BEING LATINO THAN JUST
BEING LATINO.
>> Jon: YOU MEAN BECAUSETHEY'RE WEAK ON IMMIGRATION.
>> WELL, SURE, I MEANBUT MAINLY BECAUSE THEIR'S
CUBAN.>> Jon: WHAT?
>> AND REALLY, A SMALL, AND IGOT TO BE HONEST, A SNOOTY
SUBSET, LIKE THE WASPS OFTHE LATINO WORLD.
YOU CAN'T EXPECT THE BULK OFUS NONCUBAN LATINOS TO GO
CRAZY FOR TWO CUBAN GUYS WHOTHREW AWAY A PATH TO
CITIZENSHIP FOR A PATH TOTHE WHITE HOUSE.
ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHO ISACTUALLY FROM CANADA.
>> Jon: YEAH, THAT'S-- BUTNOW I'M CONFUSED.
SO IF MARCO RUBIO AND TEDCRUZ ARE NOT THE LATINOS IN
THE RACE WHO IS THE LATINOIN THE REPUBLICAN RACE?
>> JON, LISTEN AND I WILL TELLYOU A TALE OF THE LEGEND OF A
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHOSPEAKS FLUENT SPANISH AND HAS
A MEXICAN WIFE WHO RAISEDMEXICAN CHILDREN AND
REGULARLY EATS MEXICAN FOODAND THIS MAN IS A REPUBLICAN.

SEE, MOST CANDIDATES ARESCRAMBLING TO GO AFTER
LATINOS NOW BUT JEB BUSHSTARTED HIS OUTREACH PROGRAM
IN 1974.

AMERICAN SOUL.

REALLY GOOD GUACOMOLE.
>> YOU HEAR HOW THATGUACOMOLE ROLLS OFF HIS
TONGUE?

MEANINGFUL PATH TOCITIZENSHIP AND HE MIGHT BE
THE ONE WE'VE ALL BEENWAITING FOR.
