[APPLAUSE]
>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW," EVERYBODY.
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW.
WE HAVE A GOOD SHOW.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, AUSTAN
GOOLSBEE.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT'S MY CRYPT KEEPER
IMPRESSION.
"GOOLSBEE."
ALL RIGHT.
TURNS OUT YOU WERE RIGHT THE
FIRST TIME.
ALL RIGHT.
WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT HOW DIVIDED
OUR COUNTRY IS AND JUST HOW
HOSTILE THE OPPOSING PARTIES IN
OUR POLITICAL DEBATE HAVE
BECOME AND THE FEAR THESE
DIVISIONS ARE SO ENTRENCHED AS
TO BE PERMANENT.
WELL, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.
>> SIX-YEAR-OLD LUCY MAGNUM IS
THE BRAVE LITTLE GIRL WHO NEARLY
LOST HER RIGHT LEG LAST WEEK
AFTER A FIVE-FOOT SHARK ATTACKED
HER.
>> NOW THIS LITTLE GIRL, LITTLE
LUCY MAGNUM, SAYS SHE FORGIVES
THIS WILD BEAST.
LOOK AT THIS.
>> DID YOU FORGIVE THAT NICE
SHARK?
>> [INAUDIBLE].
>> SHE SAID, "HE REALLY DIDN'T
MEAN TO DO IT."
[AUDIENCE REACTS]
>> Jon: AND EVEN IF THAT
LITTLE GIRL IS, QUITE FRANKLY,
WRONG ABOUT THE SHARK...
[LAUGHTER]
BECAUSE I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT SHARK MEANT
TO DO THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
IF NATURAL ENEMIES LIKE A LITTLE
GIRL AND SHARK, WHO HAVE BEEN
FIGHTING, AS YOU KNOW, FOR
CENTURIES -- SOMETIMES THE SHARK
WINNING, SOMETIMES THE LITTLE
GIRLS WINNING -- IF THEY CAN
FIND FORGIVENESS IN THIS AGE-OLD
BATTLE, ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT
OUR POLITICAL LEADERS, WHETHER
THEY BE DEMOCRATS, WHETHER THEY
BE REPUBLICANS, OH, YES.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT THEY CAN COME TOGETHER IN A
SHARED FEELING OF... NO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
NO!
NOOOOOO!
[LAUGHTER]
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE TRUNK WOULD
WAGGLE IN THAT KIND OF MANNER.
THAT WAS MY FAULT.
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE PUT
THE TWO OF THEM IN THE SAME BOX
LIKE THAT, BUT MY POINT IS THIS.
THE NEWS THAT WASHINGTON HAD
COME TO AN AGREEMENT OVER THE
RAISING OF A DEBT CEILING HAS
NOT EASED PARTISAN TENSION.
EVEN AS THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE
LEGISLATION, A SIGNING DONE IN
PRIVATE, OR AS SOME MIGHT SAY,
"HIDING," I THINK WE STILL HAVE
THE AUDIO, THOUGH.
CAN WE...
>> MOTHER [BLEEPED], GOD "THE
SLEEP EASY SOLUTION."
CRAM IT UP THEIR ASS SIDEWAY,
GODDAMN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon:, I DON'T KNOW WHY THE
WHITE HOUSE RELEASED THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT WHILE THE VICIOUS CHILDISH
ALMOST COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY
DEBT CEILING BATTLE HAS TAKEN
ITS TOLL ON ALL AMERICANS, THE
PROTRACTED NATURE OF THIS DEBATE
HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD ON OUR
SENIOR CITIZENS.
WELL, ON ONE SENIOR CITIZEN IN
PARTICULAR.
>> FOR ME PERSONALLY I'VE BEEN
HERE FAR LONG TIME.
I HAVE A HOME IN NEVADA.
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN MONTHS.
MY MOM GRANITE TREES ARE, I'M
TOLD, BLOSSOMING AND THE
POMEGRANATES ON THEM.
I HAVE FIG TREES AND ROSES AND
STUFF I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN.
[LAUGHTER]
>> Jon: YOUR POMEGRANATE AND
FIG TREES ARE... WHAT ARE YOU,
THE SULTAN OF RENO?
[LAUGHTER]
SOMETIMES THE MYTH OF EUCALYPTUS
WOULD SETTLE OVER MY PISTACHIOS
AND MY HAREM WOULD PREPARE ME A
PLATE OF CANDIED DATES AND
