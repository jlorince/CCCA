>> Jon:  WELCOME TO THE "DAILY SHOW." I'M JON STEWART.
MAN OH, MAN OH, MAN OH, MAN.
WE HAVE A PROGRAM FOR YOU TONIGHT.
THE LOVELY MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL WILL BE JOINING US.
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) EXCELLENT ACTRESS.
AS YOU KNOW, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONUX LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS AWAY, IT'S A TIME WHEN THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE REFLECT ON THE STATE OF NATION AND THE NEEDS OF ITS CITIZENRY, EXAMINE WHICH
PRESIDENT'S CANDIDATE WOULD BEST ADDRESS THESE URGENT AND CRITICAL TIME.
( LAUGHTER ).
THAT'S OUR JOB.
THEIR JOB IS TO RAISE AS MUCH ( BLEEP ) MONEY AS THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON.
AND IT APPEARS THAT IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE WIRE.

OUR ENTIRE GRAPHICS BUDGET FOR THE YEAR.
( LAUGHTER ).
PRESIDENT OBAMA, AS THE INCUMBENT, IN TERMS OF FUND-RAISING, APPEARS TO HAVE THE INSIDE TRACK.
>> THE PRESIDENT SHATTERING RECORDS FOR FUND-RAISING EVENTS.
HE'S HELD EMERGENCY 150 SO FAR AS PRESIDENT.
THAT'S NEARLY DOUBLE THE NUMBER GEORGE W. BUSH ATTENDED DURING HIS WHOLE FIRST TERM.

THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
