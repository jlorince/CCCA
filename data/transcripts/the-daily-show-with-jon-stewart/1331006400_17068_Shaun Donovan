>> Jon: WELCOME BACK.
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS THE UNITED
STATES SECRETARY FOR HOUSING
AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT.
PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM
SECRETARY SEAN DONOVAN.
SIR.
( APPLAUSE )
HOW ARE YOU?
>> DOING WELL.
GOOD TO BE BACK IN NEW YORK.
>> Jon: ARE YOU FROM NEW YORK?
>> I AM, I AM, BORN AND BRED.
>> Jon: SO THE URBAN
DEVELOPMENT PART YOU ARE QUITE
FAMILIAR WITH.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Jon: THAT IS OUR BREAD AND
BUTTER SO TO SPEAK.
>> YOU GROW UP IN NEW YORK IN
THE 1970s AND YOU CARE ABOUT
URBAN DEVELOPMENT.
ARE YOU A YANKEES' FAN?
>> Jon: GET OUT OF MY SHOW.
>> COME ON.
>> Jon: AM I A YANKEE FAN?
MY FATHER GREW UP IN BROOKLYN.
I AM NOT ALLOWED TO BE A
YANKEE FAN.
I AM A METS FAN.
(  CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND I WILL SUFFER THEIR FATE
FOR AS LONG AS THEY CAN TO
SUCK.
I WILL STAY WITH THEM UNTIL
THE END.
YOU WERE RAISED A YANKEES'
FAN?
>> I WAS.
I WAS AT THE '77 WORLD SERIES,
THE ONE....
>> Jon: I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE
'77 WORLD SERIES.
>> I WAS TRYING TO TELL AN
DEVELOPMENT STORY.
>> Jon: BRING IT ON.
THERE'S NOTHING KIDS LOVE MORE
THAN A GOOD URBAN DEVELOPMENT
STORY.
COUCHED IN WORLD SERIES
TRIVIA.
>> YOU HAVE THE CAMERA POINT
ACROSS THE OUTFIELD AND HE
SAID LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE
BRONX IS BURNING.
DOZENS OF BUILDINGS WERE
BURNING.
IT LOST 75% OF ITS POPULATION
DURING THE 1970s.
DEVASTATION.
>> Jon: THE WHOLE CITY WAS...
I REMEMBER THE CITY.
IN THE LATE '60s EARLY '70s
THERE WAS A GANG WAR BEING
FOUGHT BETWEEN THE POLICE AND
DIFFERENT GROUPS AND HOUSING
AND THE CITY WAS BROKE.
APPARENTLY HOMELESSNESS WAS
INCREDIBLE.
AND THEN I GUESS IN THE '80s
WE FIGURED OUT WE COULD PULT
THEM SOMEWHERE.
AND THEY WOULD STILL BE
HOMELESS BUT WE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.
>> WE'RE DOING A LITTLE BETTER
THAN THAT THESE DAYS.
>> Jon: WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT PLANNED NOW?
>> THE THING WE FINALLY
FIGURED OUT IS THAT IT'S
ACTUALLY NOT ONLY BETTER FOR
PEOPLE BUT CHEAPER TO SOLVE
HOMELESSNESS THAN IT IS TO PUT
A BAND-AID ON IT BECAUSE AT
THE END OF THE DAY IT COSTS
BETWEEN SHELTERS AND EMERGENCY
ROOMS AND JAILS IT COSTS ABOUT
$40,000 A YEAR FOR A HOMELESS
PERSON TO BE ON THE STREET.
>> Jon: ISN'T SO MUCH OF IT
TIED UP ALSO IN THE MENTAL
HEALTH SYSTEM BECAUSE AN AWFUL
LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE STREET
ARE SUFFERING FROM
DISABILITIES AND ILLNESSES
THAT ARE UNTREATED?
ISN'T THAT PART OF IT AS WELL.
>> WHAT'S AMAZING PARTICULARLY
ON THAT POINT, A VETERAN IS
50% MORE LIKELY TO BE HOMELESS
THAN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN.
>> Jon: REALLY?
>> BECAUSE OF PTSD AND
EVERYTHING THEY GO TO.
ONE IN SIX HOMELESS PEOPLE IS
A VETERAN.
>> Jon: DO YOU CATEGORIZE
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT
INTO THE WORKING POOR THAT
HAVE FALLEN INTO A DIFFICULT
SITUATION AND FIND THEMSELVES
HOMELESS AND THOSE WHO NEED
MORE, I GUESS, CARE FROM MORE
PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES?
IS THAT THE SPLIT?
>> WE HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF
HOUSING THAT SERVES ALL
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
DEPENDING ON WHAT THEIR NEEDS
ARE.
WHAT'S AMAZING IS THAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY EVEN IN THIS CRISIS
WE'RE MAKING REAL PROGRESS.
WE LOWERED THE NUMBER OF
VETERANS SLEEPING ON THE
STREETS LAST YEAR BY 20%.
>> Jon: THE IDEA OF VETERANS
SLEEPING ON THE STREETS IS
INCREDIBLY UPSETTING FOR ALL
THEY'VE DONE SO NOT BE ABLE TO
TAKE CARE OF THAT.
>> LOOK, EVEN IN THESE FISCAL
TIMES WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO
END VETERANS HOMELESSNESS BY
2015.
PRESIDENT OBAMA DID THAT.
WE ARE ON TRACK FOR THAT.
WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE
AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND ON
HOMELESSNESS BY ABOUT 15%
BECAUSE WE THINK WE CAN END
THE CRISIS.
>> Jon: WHAT ARE THE HOMELESS
NUMBERS IN THE CURRENT
RECESSION AND HOW MUCH IS THAT
WORKING POOR THAT HAVE SLIPPED
UNDER THAT BAR?
>> WE'VE DONE BETTER AND
BETTER WITH WHAT WE CALL
CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS.
THOSE ARE THE FOLKS WE MOSTLY
THINK ABOUT.
SINGLES LIVING ON THE STREETS.
THE SCARY THING IS THAT IN THE
CRISIS THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES
FACING HOMELESSNESS,.
>> Jon: FORECLOSURES?
>> A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE
LIVING IN RENTAL HOUSING WHO
GOT DISPLACED AS WELL.
THERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE
SOME PROGRESS.
WE ACTUALLY LOWERED.
WE HEAR ALL THESE THINGS ABOUT
THE STIMULUS BILL, RIGHT?
WE'VE SAVED ABOUT $1.2 MILLION
PEOPLE FROM HOMELESSNESS JUST
THROUGH THE RECOVERY ACT.
>> Jon: JUST THE IDEA THERE'S
1.2 MILLION PEOPLE THAT WE SAY
SDTS AND THAT'S ASTONISHING.
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHAT'S
GOING ON.
WHAT IS THE NEW... YOU GOT
YOURSELF $26 BILLION IN I
GUESS REFINANCE MONEY.
WHAT IS THIS NEW SETTLEMENT
THAT CAME OUT?
$26 BILLION MORTGAGE
SETTLEMENT.
DOES THAT HELP THESE PEOPLE AS
WELL OR PEOPLE TRYING TO SAVE
THEIR OWN HOMES.
>> IT HELPS A BUNCH OF RENTERS
WHO ARE LIVING IN HOMES THAT
HAVE BEEN FORECLOSED.
YOU REPORTED ABOUT THIS.
>> Jon: I WHAT?
YOU MEAN I'VE MADE SNARKY
JOKES ABOUT THAT.
>> YOU SAID IT, NOT ME.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
>> YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE HEARD
THESE STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE
LOSING THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THE
BANK WEREN'T EVEN LOOKING....
>> Jon: THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE
PAPER.
>> YOU DID A STORY ABOUT AN
ELDERLY WOMAN WHO WAS LOCKED
INTO HER HOME BECAUSE THEY
THOUGHT THEY WERE LOCKING HER
OUT OF HER HOME.
THEY CHANGED THE LOCKS.
>> Jon: THAT'S RIGHT.
>> WE WENT AND LOOKED AND
FOUND AS HIGH AS 60% OF
FORECLOSE FORECLOSURES WERE
BEING DONE WRONG.
WE WENT AFTER THE BANKS FOR IT
AND GOT $25 BILLION A FEW
WEEKS AGO.
IT'S THE SINGLE BIG OFT
SETTLEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF
THE COUNTRY BETWEEN STATES AND
FEDS.
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET IS
ACTUALLY WRITING DOWN PEOPLE'S
MORTGAGES TO KEEP THEM IN
THEIR HOME.
>> Jon: HERE'S THE INCREDIBLE
THING THAT YOU'RE FINDING OUT
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE FROM ME.
>> THIS IS HOW GOOD IT GOT
HERE.
>> Jon: DO YOU HAVE FIVE
MINUTES?
>> YES.
>> Jon: ON THE WEBB, SECRETARY
SEAN DONOVAN.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
