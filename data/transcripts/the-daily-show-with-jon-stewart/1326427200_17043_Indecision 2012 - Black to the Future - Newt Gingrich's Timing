FOR MORE SENIOR POLITICAL
ANALYST WYATT CENAC JOINS US
RIGHT NOW.
WYATT WHAT DO YOU
MAKE-- WHAT DOW MAKE OF
THESE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
THESE LATEST REMARKS BY NEWT
GINGRICH.
>> JON, LET'S JUST SAY IT,
THAT IS SOME RACIST BULL
[BLEEP].
I MEAN IT IS 2012.
WHAT TOOK HIM SO LONG.
>> Jon: WAIT, ARE YOU UP SET
HE HASN'T MADE RACIST
REMARKS SOONER.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF HIS
REMARKS WERE RACIST, THAT'S
JUST NEWT BEING
CONDESCENDINGING AND DICKISH
OR AS HE CALLS IT, TALKING.
WHAT'S RACIST IS HIS TIMING.
IT TOOK GINGRICH UNTIL NOW
TO BE CONDESCENDING AND
DICKISH TO BLACK PEOPLE?
FIVE YEARS AGO HE WAS
ALREADY DOING THIS TO
HISPANICS.
>> WE SHOULD REPLACE
BILINGUAL EDUCATION WITH
IMMERSION IN ENGLISH SO THEY
LEARN THE LANGUAGE OF
PROSPERITY, NOT THE LANGUAGE
OF LIVING IN A GHETTO.
>> I NEVER HEARD HIM SAY
THAT ABOUT RAT MUSIC OR
EBONICS, WHAT, OUR LANGUAGE
OF LIVING IN THE GHETTO
ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM?
>> Jon: CAN I JUST GO BACK
FOR A SECOND.
DID YOU JUST SAY SPANISH WAS
THE LANGUAGE OF THE GHETTO?
>> OH, NO, BUT HE APOLOGIZED
IN BROKEN GHETTO LANGUAGE.
>> SPEAKING SPANISH).
>> YEAH.
IN THE CRAPPIEST SPANISH
EVER, THAT GUY ALREADY
PATRONIZED AND APOLOGISED TO
HISPANICS BEFORE HE EVER GOT
AROUND TO INSULTING BLACK
PEOPLE!
>> Jon: BUT, BUT ISN'T THAT
IN AND OF ITSELF BY IGNORING
BLACK PEOPLE INSULTING AND
PATRONIZING.
>> NO, DON'T TRY AND MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.
THIS GUY HAS BEEN A DICK TO
GAYS, OTHER REPUBLICANS,
SCIENCE, WOMEN.
>> TALKING ABOUT BEING IN
COMBAT.
WHAT IS COMBAT MEAN?
IF COMBAT MEANS LIVING IN A
DITCH, FEMALES HAVE
BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS STAYING
IN A DITCH FOR 30 DAYS.
BECAUSE THEY GET INFECTIONS.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT, WOMEN ARE
TOO FRAIL TO SERVE IN THE
MILITARY.
THIS COMING FROM A GUY WHO
PROBABLY CAN'T GET OUT OF A
POOL BY HIMSELF.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
>> I MEAN LOOK, HE WAS
CONDESCENDING AND DICKISH TO
A CERTAIN PEOPLE THREE
MONTHS BEFORE GOING AFTER
BLACK PEOPLE.
>> AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE
HADN'T INVENTED PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE WHO-- WERE
HISTORICALLY PART OF THE
ARAB COMMUNITY.
>> HE DOESN'T THINK
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE EXIST,
JON!
I MEAN I'M SURPRISED THE GUY
DIDN'T [BLEEP] SMURFS BEFORE
THINKING BLACK PEOPLE ARE
WORTHY OF HIS DISDAIN.
>> Jon: WYATT, MAYBE HE IS
JUST SAVING THE BEST FOR
LAST.
>> NO, NO, HUH-UH, WE HAVE
WORKED TOO HARD AND COME TOO
FAR TO NOT HAVE SOMEONE TELL
US WE DIDN'T WORK HARD
ENOUGH.
NO.
BLACK PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE
TO SIT AT THE BACK OF THE
BUS WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO
CALL US LAZY FOR BEING AT
THE BACK OF THE BUS.
>> Jon: THANK YOU, WYATT.
WYATT CENAC,
