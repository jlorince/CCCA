[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT WE'RE VERYEXCITED SAUDI FILMMAKER HAIFAA
AL MANSOUR WILL BE ON THE SHOW.
SHE'S DONE THIS FILM WAJADA.
TREMENDOUS.
OFF THE TOP YOU MAY RECALL IFYOU'VE SEEN OUR PROGRAM LAST
WEEK WE HAD A LITTLE SPIRITEDFUN WITH MEGYN KELLY.
WE'RE REALLY SCAMPS.
HER RESPONSE TO SANTA BEING ACOLOR OTHER THAN WHITE.
>> KIDS AT HOME SANTA IS WHITE.
WE'RE JUST DEBATING THIS BECAUSESOMEONE WROTE ABOUT IT.
>> Jon: SEE.
[ LAUGHTER ]LIKE MOST DEBATES IT STARTED BY
GIVING YOU THE DEFINITIVE ANSWERFIRST.
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY FOR MISSKELLY FOR FOX HER PROGRAM IS
TELEVISED.
AND PEOPLE WHOSAW THE SEGMENT
OR READ ABOUT IT EXPRESSED ANOPINION THAT WHAT SHE SAID WAS
WRONG AND DEFENSIVE AND ODDLYDEFINITIVE FOR A DISCUSSION OF A
FICTIONAL CHARACTER AND(bleep)ED.
PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS LIKEREALLY (bleep)ED UP.
THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE ECONOMISTSTAKE ON IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]BUT ON FRIDAY MISS KELLY TOOK TO
THE AIRWAVES TO CLEAR THINGS UP.
>> IN KICKING OFF A LIGHTHEARTED SEGMENT I OFFERED A
TONGUE IN CHEEK MESSAGE FOR ANYKIDS WATCHING SAYING THAT SANTA,
WHO I JOKED IS A REAL PERSONWHOSE RACE IS IDENTIFIABLE IS
WHITE.
AN OFFHAND JEST IS NOW ANATIONAL FIRESTORM.
HUMOR IS SOMETHING WE TRY TOBRING TO THE SHOW BUT SOMETIME
IT'S LOST ON THE HUMORLESS ANDFOX NEWS AND YOURS TRULY ARE BIG
TARGETS FOR MANY PEOPLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: I GUESS WE ALL OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.
[ LAUGHTER ]WHAT APPEARED TO ME TO BE
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A FOX NEWSSEGMENT EXPRESSING ANGER AND
VICTIMIZATION OVER THE LOSS OFABSOLUTE POWER AND REFRAMING
THAT AS PERSECUTION OF REALTHAT AMERICA BY MINORITIES,
FREELOADERSAND SOCIALISTS --
[LAUGHTER]-- THAT IS TRADEMARKED, BY THE
WAY.
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THAT WASACTUALLY A JEST, A JAPE.
I'M SURE IF WE LOOK AT THEORIGINAL CLIP AGAIN IN THAT
CONTEXT WE'LL FIND IT ASHUMOROUS AS IT WAS SINCERELY
INTENDED TO BE.
>> FOR ALL YOU KIDS WATCHING ATHOME, SANTA JUST IS WHITE.
JESUS WAS A WHITE MAN, TOO.
JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEELUNCOMFORTABLE DOESN'T MEAN IT
HAS TO CHANGE.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: OH, I GET IT.
[ LAUGHTER ]>> Jon: OH, I GET IT.
