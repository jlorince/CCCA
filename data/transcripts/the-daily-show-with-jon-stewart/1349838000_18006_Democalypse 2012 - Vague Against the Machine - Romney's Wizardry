DON'T THINK I WOULD WANT TO
TAKE.
ROMNEY, WHAT ARE YOU CUTTING?
ANYTHING?
>> OBAMACARE ADS TRILLIONS TO
OUR DEFICITS AND TO OUR NATIONAL
DEBT.
I WILL REPEAL OBAMACARE.
>> Jon: ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S SOMETHING.
AND WHILE THE STATEMENT
"OBAMACARE ADDS TRILLIONS TO OUR
DEFICIT AND TO OUR NATIONAL
DEBT" IS A LIE!
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S A COMPLETE LIE.
(LAUGHTER)
THE POINT IS IT'S GOING.
WE HAVE AN IMMORAL DEBT.
WHILE COVERING PEOPLE WITH
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND
KEEPING PEOPLE ON THEIR PARENT'S
HEALTH INSURANCE IS POPULAR,
CUTS HAVE TO BE MADE.
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS
THAT I LIKE IN HEALTH CARE
REFORM.
ONE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE
WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS CAN
GET COVERAGE.
TWO IS TO ASSURE THAT THE
MARKETPLACE ALLOWS FOR
INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE POLICIES
THAT COVER THEIR FAMILY UP TO
WHATEVER AGE THEY MIGHT LIKE.
>> Jon: SO YOU'RE REPEALING
OBAMACARE BUT YOU'RE KEEPING THE
GOOD PARTS OF HEALTH CARE,
SOCIAL SECURITY, AND MEDICARE
FOR CURRENT SENIORS AND YOU'RE
GOING TO KEEP THE EMPLOYMENT AND
YOU'RE GOING TO CUT TAXES BY 20%
AND BUILD MORE SUBMARINES AND
DESTROYERS THAT THE PENTAGON
DOESN'T WANT AND TACKLE OUR
IMMORAL DEBT AND DEFICIT.
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.
LET ME SEE IF I GOT IT HERE.
AS AN AMERICAN VOTER-- AND I
THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT-- ARE
YOU A WIZARD?
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
DO YOU KNOW OR HAVE YOU EVER
CAPTURED A LEPRECHAUN?
(LAUGHTER)
IS THERE A GOOSE IN YOUR HOUSE
WHOSE EGGS ARE GIGANTIC AND
UNLIFTBLY HEAVY IN?
BECAUSE IF NOT, YOU'RE LYING!
(LAUGHTER)
>> LET'S GET RID OF THE
LOOPHOLES, DEDUCTIONS, SPECIAL
DEALS SUCH THAT WE'RE ABLE TO
PAY FOR THE REDUCTIONS.
>> Jon: OH, THAT'S HOW YOU'LL
PAY.
CLOSING LOOPHOLES.
LET'S DO IT.
WHAT ARE WE STARTING WITH?
MORTGAGE INTEREST AND CHARITABLE
DONATIONS?
THAT'S $150 BILLION A YEAR IN
THE GOVERNMENT KITTY.
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU
UNDERSTAND, FOR MIDDLE INCOME
FAMILIES THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF
HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST AND THE
CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS, THOSE
THINGS WILL CONTINUE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: KITTY STILL HUNGRY.
HOW ABOUT THE CAP AL GAINS
LOOPHOLE THAT LOWER TAX RATE ON
INVESTMENT INCOME.
THAT'S $71 BILLION AYEAR,
GIVEAWAY TO 1%ERS IF THERE EVER
WAS ONE.
>> ONE OF THE REASON THAT IT'S
LOWER IS BECAUSE CAPITAL HAS
ALREADY BEEN TAXED ONCE AT THE
CORPORATE LEVEL.
AS HIGH AS 35%.
I, SO I YOU THINK IT IS FAIR?
>> YEAH, I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT
WAY TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC
GROWTH.
>> IN FACT, ROMNEY HASN'T
SPECIFIED A SINGLE (BLEEP)ING
DEDUCTION!
TEN LARGEST CURRENT INDIVIDUAL
TAX BREAKS TOTALING $4842
BILLION A YEAR FOR ELIMINATION,
NOT ONE.
DUDE COULDN'T BE MORE VAGUE IF
HE WERE AN HBO SEASON FINALE.
BOOM!
BOOM!
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
TAKE THAT "HUNG" SEASON 3.
(LAUGHTER)
HOW COULD HE THEY NOT LET US
KNOW WHAT RAY IS G
