>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILY
SHOW, MY NAME IS JON
STEWART.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, JUDGE
ANDREW NAPOLITANO WILL BE
JOINING US.
A FINE MAN, WE'RE EXCITED TO
HAVE HIM ON THE PROGRAM.
BUT WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN THE
FIELD OF PRESIDENTIAL
POLITICS HAVE.
YOU BEEN FOLLOWING THE GOP
PRESIDENTIAL RACE YOU KNOW
THAT HIT ENS ROMNEY HAS
BEEN-- MITTENS ROMNEY HAS
BEEN THE UNCONTESTED
FRONT-RUNNER FOR EVERYONE'S
SECOND CHOICE.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: FOR THE REPUBLICAN
NOMINATION.
HE'S THE SUBJECT OF
TONIGHT'S INSTALLMENT OF
INDECISION 2012, SCARED
MITTLESS.
(LAUGHTER)
WHEN POLLING BEGAN A YEAR
AGO, POLLING BEGAN A YEAR
AGO FOR THE REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENTIAL RACE MITT
ROMNEY WAS POLLING IN THE
LOW -- AND WAS IN SECOND
PLACE.
AND SINCE THEN SO MUCH HAS
CHANGED.
>> MINNESOTA CONGRESSWOMAN
MICHELE BACHMANN SURGING
AHEAD OF THE 2012 FIELD.
>> HUCKABEE LEADS 19% A
ROMNEY IS TRAILING, WITH
18%.
>> GALLUP HAS PERRY LEADING
WITH 29%, MITT ROMNEY NOW
SECOND WITH 17%.
>> THEN GOVERNOR CHRISTIE
TIED FOR FIRST PLACE WITH
THE FORMER MASSACHUSETTS
GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY.
>> IN THE LATEST CNN POLL OF
REPUBLICANS ROMNEY CAME IN
SECOND TO RUDY GIULIANI WHO
IS NOT EVEN RUNNING.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: IN FACT, TONIGHT HE
IS LOSING TO REE ANIMATED
RONALD REAGAN.
OR REAGAN.
LOWER TAXES ON BRAINS.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT AS FRONT-RUNNERS HAVE
COME AND GONE ROMNEY REMAINS.
LET'S CHECK IN WHERE HE'S AT
RIGHT NOW.
>> NOW A YEAR LATER MITT
ROMNEY SITS AT ABOUT 23%
SUPPORT.
MITT ROMNEY IS MR. 23%.
>> Jon: MR. 23%.
STILL A BETTER NICK NAME
THAN MITT.
SO WHEN IT AM COULDS TO HIS
POLLING NUMBERS MITT ROMNEY
HAS BEEN NOTHING IF NOT
CONSISTENT WHICH IS
INTERESTING, GIVEN THAT IN
EVERY OTHER REGARD, HE HAS
BEEN SHOCKINGLY INCONSISTENT.
HOW HAS HE MANAGED TO
NEITHER GAIN NOR LOSE
SUPPORT.
TO REMAIN INERT, IF HE WERE
A COLOR HE WOULD BE BEIGE.
IF HE WERE AN ICE CREAM
FLAVOR, HE'D BE BEIGE.
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, HERE'S HOW HE DOES IT.
IN JUNE ROMNEY POSTS ON
FACEBOOK THAT HE WAS
SUPPORTIVE OF A BALLOT
INITIATIVE TO CONTINUE
RESTRICTING THE COLLECTIVE
BARGAINING RIGHTS OF
TEACHERS, POLICEMAN AND
FIREFIGHTERS.
A BOLD STAND THAT COULD GAIN
HIM MAYBE A 3 TO 5% BUMP
AMONGST THE REPUBLICAN BASE,
HUNGRY TO RESTRAIN UNIONS.
BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE HE
COULD LOSE HIM SUPPORT IN
THE GENERAL ELECTION FOR
PEOPLE NOT AS CONVINCED THAT
PUBLIC SERVICE UNIONS ARE
SOCIALISM.
HOW DO YOU SOLVE THAT
PROBLEM?
SMASH CUT TO TWO DAYS AGO,
MITT ROMNEY STANDING OUTSIDE
THE REPUBLICAN CALL CENTER
IN OHIO THAT HE HAS JUST
VISITED THAT IS WORKING TO
PASS THE BALLOT INITIATIVES
HE HAS PREVIOUSLY FRIENDED.
>> I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT
THE PARTICULAR BALLOT ISSUES.
THOSE ARE UNDER THE PEOPLE
OF OHIO BUT I SUPPORT THE
EFFORT OF THE GOVERNOR TO
RAIL IN THE SCALE OF
GOVERNMENT.
I'M NOT TERRIBLY FAMILIAR
WITH THE TWO BALLOT
INITIATIVES.
>> Jon: NOT FAMILIAR, YOU
THUMBS UP THEM ON FACEBOOK!
(LAUGHTER)
YOU JUST VISITED WITH
REPUBLICANS WORKING TO PASS
THEM BEHIND-- WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO THEM DURING THE
VISIT?
>> I WANT EVERYONE IN HERE
TO KNOW I STAND NEAR YOU.
(LAUGHTER)
SO KEEP UP THE WORK.
(LAUGHTER)
SO ANY BUMP THAT ROMNEY
WOULD GET TO SUPPORT THE
INITIATIVE FROM THE
REPUBLICAN BASE IS NOW GONE.
BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE MAYBE
HE'LL GAIN SOME RESPECT AND
A BUMP FROM MORE CENTRIST
MODERATE REPUBLICANS OR
INDEPENDENTS FOR BEING
NONCOMMITTAL.
HOW CAN HE [BLEEP] THAT UP?
(LAUGHTER)
SMASH CUT TO THE NEXT DAY.
>> I'M SORRY IF I CREATED
ANY CONFUSION IN THAT
REGARD.
I FULLY SUPPORT GOVERNOR
KASICH'S-- I THINK IS CALLED
QUESTION TWO IN OHIO.
FULLY SUPPORT THAT.
>> Jon: FULLY SUPPORT, SO
WHAT WAS YOUR YESTERDAY-- I
DON'T KNOW, COULD BE DOING
ANYTHING IN THAT BUILDING, I
DON'T KNOW.
COULD BE A VERIZE ON CALL
CENTER FOR ALL I KNOW.
>> I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER
BALLOT QUESTIONS THERE IN
OHIO AND I WASN'T TAKING A
POSITION ON THOSE.
I DON'T WANT TO TELL THEM
WHAT I THINK THEY OUGHT TO
DO IN THAT REGARD.
ONE OF THEM, FOR INSTANCE,
RELATES TO HEALTH CARE AND
MANDATES.
I'VE SAID THAT THAT SHOULD
BE UP TO INDEPENDENT STATES.
I TOOK MY STATE IN ONE
DIRECTION.
THEY MAY WANT TO GO IN A
DIFFERENT DIRECTION
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: HOW DOES A MORMON
END UP SOUNDING LIKE JACKIE
MASON.
(LAUGHTER)
>> THEY COULD TAKE IF IN ONE
DIRECTION, MAYBE IN THE
OTHER DIRECTION.
-- I WAS GOING THIS, BA-DING.
HEALTH CARE, THE THING, ON
THE OTHER HAND, BOOM, BOOM,
HEY, HO.
(APPLAUSE)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> AND YOU TRY TO DISTRACT
THE REPUBLICAN BASE FROM
YOUR WISHY WASHY UNION STAND
BY BRINGING UP YOUR
HEALTH-CARE PLAN?
ROMNEYCARE?
THEY HATE THAT.
THAT'S LIKE GOING HEY, WHY'S
EVERYBODY LOOKING AT THE
PIMP EL ON MY NOSE.
A [BLEEP] MY PANTS!
NOW--
(APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)
