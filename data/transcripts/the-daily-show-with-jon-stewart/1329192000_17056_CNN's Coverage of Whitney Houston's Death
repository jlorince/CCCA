>> Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW," MY NAME IS JON STEWART.
HEY, WE'RE BACK!
WE'RE BACK.
THIS... RIGHT NOW, WHAT WE'RE
DOING RIGHT NOW, THIS IS NOT A
RERUN-- UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE WATCHING THIS EPISODE
FIVE WEEKS FROM NOW WHEN WE GET
ANOTHER UNREASONABLY UNDESERVED
VACATION.
(LAUGHTER)
SO TONIGHT WE HAVE A VERY COOL
GUEST, A FORMER SPECIAL AGENT
WHO SPENT THE LAST TEN YEARS
BATTLING AL QAEDA AS A
COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATIVE.
IT'S A TERRIFIC TIME FOR YOU TO
LOOK BACK ON THE LAST DECADE OF
YOUR LIFE AND REALLY...
(LAUGHTER)
REASSESS.
I THINK REASSESS.
SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO DWELL ON
THE WEEKEND SAD NEWS, WE CAN'T
PROCESS THAT.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING?
NEITHER COULD CNN.
(LAUGHTER)çó
HERE THEY ARE BREAKING THE SAD
NEWS ONE PERSON AT A TIME.
>> NEWS JUST BROKE, IT'S NOT SO
GOOD NEWS.
WHITNEY HOUSTON HAS DIED.
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> WHITNEY HOUSTON PASSED AWAY.
>> SHE DID?
WHAT
>> WHAT?
>> YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
>> NOPE, JUST HAPPENED.
(LAUGHTER)
>> Jon: DEAL WITH IT, WHATEVER.
YOU CAN'T JUST GO OUT IN THE
STREETS WITH A CAMERA CREW
SURPRISING PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW
SOMEBODY FAMOUS HAS DIED.
YOU CAN'T...
(LAUGHTER)
ISN'T THE THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO USE TO INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT
THESE DEATHS YOUR NETWORK?
I THOUGHT...
(LAUGHTER)
THE WHOLE POINT OF BROADCASTING
YOUR SIGNAL, S THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO WITH THE NEWS TOWN
CRIER STYLE DOOR TO DOOR, YOU'RE
GIVING THE NEWS OF THIS DEATH
THE SAME WAY IN TIMES SQUARE
THEY PASS OUT NAIL SALON
COUPONS.
THAT'S NOT...
(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S NOT... THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
WHAT IS THE POINT?
IS THE POINT OF CNN NOW TO JUST
SHOW PEOPLE GOING "WHAT?"ñr
BECAUSE THAT'S THE POINT OF
CANDID CAMERA.
WE'VE PLACED A NEWS REPORTER
INSIDE A MAILBOX WITH THE NEWS A
CELEBRITY THEY LOVE IS DYING.
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY TRY
TO MAIL A LETTER.
