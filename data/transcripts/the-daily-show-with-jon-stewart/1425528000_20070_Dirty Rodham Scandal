>> Jon: WELCOME TO THE DAILYSHOW, MY NAME IS JON
STEWART.
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOUTONIGHT.
OUR GUEST TONIGHT, AFASCINATING FIGURE, RUSSIAN
HOCKEY LEGEND SLAVA FETISOV.
HE IS GOING TO BE HERE TOTALK ABOUT HOW I
MISPRONOUNCED HIS NAME,WHICH I CAN ONLY ASSUME.
BUT I REMEMBER THIS CAT FROMTHE '80s AND '90s, ONE OF
THE GREATEST DEFENSEMAN EVERTO PLAY THE GAME OF HOCKEY.
BUT FIRST, HAVE YOU HEARDTHE NEWS?
EXTRA, EXTRA, FUTUREPRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON
MAY HAVE TO PARDON FORMERSECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY
CLINTON.
>> A BOMBSHELL REPORT THATHILLARY CLINTON MAY HAVE
VIOLATED THE LAW DURING HERTIME AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT.
>> Jon: OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OHMY GOD, OH MY GOD.
(LAUGHTER) WHAT DID SHE DO?
DID SHE FUNNEL ARMS TO ISISTO PAY FOR A LAND DEAL IN
ARKANSAS? DID SHE SELL ALASKABACK TO THE RUSSIANS IN EXCHANGE
FOR THEIR SILENCE ON BENGHAZI?WHAT DID SHE DO?
PAD HER RESUME WITH FAKECOUNTRIES SHE SUPPOSEDLY
NEGOTIATED TREATIES WITH? ISHOULD HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS NO
SUCH THING AS PANTSUITISTAN?
HIT ME WITH THE BAD NEWS.
>> IT APPEARS THAT WHILE SHEWAS SECRETARY OF STATE SHE
DID NOT HAVE AN OFFICIALE-MAIL ACCOUNT AT ALL.
>> OH.
IS THAT AGAINST THE LAW NOT TOHAVE AN E-MAIL ACCOUNT?
I MEAN, IT SEEMS LESS OF ASCANDAL AND MORE OF LIKE A
NERD SNAP. LIKE, OH SHE'S SOOLD, SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE AN
OFFICIAL E-MAIL ACCOUNT.
LIKE, I MEAN, WHAT IS THE BIGDEAL ABOUT NOT HAVING AN
E-MAIL ACCOUNT, OR WHAT AM IMISSING HERE?
>> HILLARY CLINTON MAY HAVEBROKEN FEDERAL
RECORD-KEEPING RULES BYUSING A PERSONAL E-MAIL
ACCOUNT INSTEAD OF A STATEDEPARTMENT ACCOUNT.
THE OFFICIAL RULES ARE THATYOU ARE SUPPOSED TO USE
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS WHICHARE SAFE FOR PUBLIC RECORD
AND ARE CONSIDERED MORESECURE.
>> Jon: OH, OKAY.
WELL, THAT IS NOT NOTHING.
THAT'S-- SHE SHOULD HAVEDONE THAT, RIGHT?
BUT DON'T WE HAVE A FACILITYIN UTAH THAT COLLECTS ALL OF
OUR E-MAIL ANYWAY?
SOLVING THE WHOLE ARCHIVEPROBLEM.
CAN'T YOU JUST ASK THEM?
OR THEY DON'T [BLEEP] TALK TOYOU EITHER.
WHY IS THIS COMING OUTNOW?
WASN'T IT CLEAR TO ANYBODYWHO E-MAILED SECRETARY
CLINTON DURING THAT TIMETHAT HER E-MAIL
ADDRESS WAS HER PERSONALE-MAIL.
>> WHEN SOMEBODY IN THE WHITEHOUSE, IN THE WEST WING HAD AN
E-MAIL TO SEND TO THE SECRETARYOF STATE,
DID THEY JUST USE HER, YOU KNOW,PRIVATE E-MAIL?
HOW DID THEY GET IN CONTACTWITH HER?
DID THAT NEVER RAISE A FLAG?
>> Jon: AND DID IT NOT ALSORAISE A RED FLAG IN THE
WEST WING THAT HERPERSONAL E-MAIL WAS
DON'TTELLANYONEABOUTTHISACCOUNT@
SECRETS/SHHH.DEFINITELYNOTGOV?
COME ON, IT'S NOT LIKE THE STATEDEPARTMENT DIDN'T EVENTUALLY
GET ALL THE CLINTON E-MAILSTHAT CLINTON DECIDED THEY
SHOULD GET.
>> IN 2014, CLINTON DID HANDOVER 55,000 PAGES AFTER THE
STATE DEPARTMENT SENT AWRITTEN REQUEST FOR THE
RECORDS.
AIDES SAY THEY TOSSED OUTCLINTON'S PERSONAL NOTES
LIKE MEMOS ON HER DAUGHTER'SWEDDING.
>> Jon: I BELIEVE IT IS ASIGN THAT YOU HAVE BEEN IN
GOVERNMENT TOO LONG WHEN YOUWRITE MEMOS ABOUT
YOUR DAUGHTER'S WEDDING--
(LAUGHTER)RE: THE HAPPIEST DAY OF YOUR
LIFE.
YOUR FATHER AND I LOOKVERY FORWARD TO SHARING THE
EVENT WITH YOU. WE LOVE YOU VERYMUCH, DICTATED NOT READ.
I THINK THE CONCERN THERE ISTHAT THE AIDES ARE THE ONES
WHO GET TO DECIDE WHICHE-MAILS ARE APPROPRIATE TO
BE SHARED AS OPPOSED TO ANINDEPENDENT ARBITER THAT IS
WHY DORITOS DOESN'T GET TODECIDE WHICH INGREDIENTS
CONSUMERS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT.
OR WHY YOU DON'T GET TO TELLTHE COPS WHICH POCKETS TO
SEARCH.
>> WELL, NO, OFFICER, NOTTHAT ONE.
THAT IS MY WEED POCKET.
AND THOSE OTHER TWOGENTLEMAN GENTLEMEN ARE MY
BALLS.
IS THERE ANOTHER REASON THATSHE DIDN'T NEED TO ARCHIVE
HER E-MAILS WITH STATE?
>> SECRETARY POWELL WROTEABOUT THIS IN HIS BOOK.
HE HAD A PERSONALLAPTOP INSTALLED IN HIS
OFFICE SO HE COULDUSE PERSONAL E-MAIL.
>> Jon: HUH.
BUT I THINK THE REGULATIONSSTARTED IN 2009, WASN'T THAT
FOUR YEARS AFTER POWELLLEFT?
I MEAN IN COLIN POWELL WASUSING A PERSONAL E-MAIL
ADDRESS THEY DIDN'T REALLYHAVE RULES ON PERSONAL
E-MAILS YET, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
BACK THEN E-MAIL WASN'TREALLY AS PREVALENT, OR LAPTOP,
MAY EXPLAIN WHY POWELL FELTTHE NEED TO INSTALL ONE IN
HIS OFFICE.
>> HOW CAN WE KNOW THATCLINTON EVEN TURNED OVER ALL
HER RELEVANT E-MAIL?
>> SHE HAS TAKEN STEPS TOPRESERVE THOSE RECORDS BY
PROVIDING THE STATEDEPARTMENT WITH THE 55,000
PAGES, I THINK 55,000 IS APRETTY BIG NUMBER.
>> Jon: IT IS A BIG NUMBER.
THERE ARE BIGGER.
A MILLION, AND IT'S NOT ASBIG AS THE NUMBER OF
PAGES CLINTON ACTUALLY HAD.
BUT THAT IS THE CRAZY THINGABOUT NUMBERS.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ALWAYSTOP THEM, SOMEBODY WILL BE LIKE
YOU HAVE A HUNDRED DALMATIANS?THAT'S A [BLEEP] LOAD
OF DALMATIANS, I CAN'TIMAGINE ANYONE HAVING MORE
THAN A HUNDRED DALMATIANSAND THEN SOME LADY BEING
LIKE -- -- 101.
THAT IS A LOT OF DALMATIANSACTUALLY.
BUT IF THAT'S, YOU KNOW, HOWEVERYBODY FEELS, WHY NOT
JUST SAY THAT SECRETARYCLINTON DID TURN OVER ALL
HER E-MAILS?
>> SHE PROVIDED A HUGE, YOUKNOW, A LARGE AMOUNT,
THOSE 55,000.
>> JUST SAY IT'S EVERYTHING IFYOU THINK IT'S  --
>> WELL, HOW CAN I -- I MEAN,BRAD, I'M NOT IN HER
E-MAIL.
>> Jon: IF YOU WERE IN HERE-MAIL YOU WOULD BE IN THE
STARRING IN THE MOST BORINGTRON SEQUEL OF ALL TIME.
TRON 2 -- THE IN-BOX.
OH NO, THERE'S SPAM.
ALL RIGHT, SO IT APPEARSTHAT SECRETARY CLINTON DID
BEND THE REGULATIONS.
I ASSUME THE PROBLEM IS ITLEAVES AN INCOMPLETE RECORD
OF HER TIME OR DOES NOTALLOW FOR PROPER OVERSIGHT,
IS THAT THE IMPACT WE'REWORRIED ABOUT.
>> THIS DEVELOPMENT COULDHAVE AN IMPACT ON HER
PRESIDENTIAL HOPES.
>> Jon: HOW!
WHAT, DO YOU THINK MAYBE AWRONG E-MAIL ADDRESS-GAZI
WILL BE A BIG BOOST TO HERDEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RIVAL
TBD.
I'M SORRY, WE JUST LEARNED THATCANDIDATE TBD HAS DROPPED OUT
OF THE RACE BECAUSE --
OR PERHAPS THIS WILL AFFECTHILLARY CLINTON'S STANDING
WITH REPUBLICANS IN THEGENERAL ELECTION WHO PRETTY
MUCH ALREADY BELIEVE HER ANHER HUSBAND TO BE TREASONING
MURDERING GRIFTASAURUSES.PERSONALLY, I THINK HER
E-MAIL TROUBLE HELPS SEW UP THESENIOR VOTE, YOU KNOW, THEY CAN
RELATE.
(APPLAUSE)AND BESIDES, IT ONLY REALLY
MATTERS IF HER ACTIONS WERETECHNICALLY RIGHT OR WRONG.
>> A SPOKESPERSON SAID SHEDID ABIDE BY THE SPIRIT AND
LETTER OF THE RULES HERE ATTHE STATE DEPARTMENT.
>> THE LETTER MAYBE, BUT THESPIRIT, WE'LL BE THE JUDGE
OF THAT. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAYTO FIND OUT.
I WILL SUMMON, IF I MAY,THAT SCAMP.
HOLD ON.
THE SPIRIT OF THE RULES, OHGREAT SPIRIT, WE SUPPLICATE
FOR CLARIFICATION.
IT'S HAPPENING!
>> WHO DOES DISTURB THESPIRIT OF THE RULES?
>> Jon: DO YOU THINK HILLARYCLINTON USING PRIVATE
E-MAIL AT HER DISCRETION ASTO WHAT SHE WANTS TO TURN
OVER HONORS THE SPIRIT OFTHE REGULATION?
>> YES, WELL, I BELIEVEPERHAPS SPIRITWISE THE
CLINTON CAMP'S STANCE ON THEREGULATION IS BASICALLY--
(LAUGHTER)>> Jon: THAT SEEMED LIKE
KIND OF A LOWBROW GESTURE FORSUCH AN
ANCIENT AND WISE SPIRIT.
>> OH, REALLY, LET ME SEEWHAT MY HOLY BOOK OF RULES
SAYS ABOUT THAT.
YES.
OH, YES, THERE IT IS.
OH, WHAT'S THIS? OH, LOOK, OH!
>> Jon: SPIRIT OF THE RULES,EVERYBODY, WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK.
THAT'S JUST WEIRD.
