GLOBAL WARMING REAL.
YOU WIN THIS ROUND, SCIENCE, BUT
WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT?
WHAT'S YOUR END GAME?
AASIF MANDVI HAS MORE.
>> SCIENCE CLAIMS IT'S WORKING
TO CURE DISEASE, SAVE THE PLANET
AND SOLVE OUR GREATEST
MYSTERIES, BUT WHAT'S IT REALLY
UP TO?
FROM GLOBAL WARMING...
>> I DON'T BELIEVE GLOBAL
WARMING IS REAL.
>> TO EVOLUTION...
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT.
>> TO THE H.P.V. VACCINE.
>> HER DAUGHTER SUFFERED MENTAL
RETARDATION AS A RESULT OF THAT
VACCINE.
>> IT SEEMS SCIENCE IS UP TO
SOMETHING.
>> THERE ARE A SUBSTANTIAL
NUMBER OF SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE
MANIPULATED DATA SO THAT THEY
WILL HAVE DOLLARS ROLLING IN TO
THEIR PROJECTS.
>> COULD THESE REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATES BE RIGHT?
TONIGHT WE ANSWER THE QUESTION:
SCIENCE -- WHAT'S IT UP TO?
TO GET THE COLD, HARD FACTS ON
SCIENCE, I SAT DOWN WITH
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST
NOELLE MacFORE.
>> SCIENTISTS ARE SCAMMING THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE RIGHT AND LEFT
FOR THEIR OWN FINANCIAL GAIN.
>> NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY, I DON'T
WANT TO SAY EVIDENCE, NOT DATA.
>> I THINK EVERY AMERICAN, IF
THEY REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
WOULD HAVE A GUT FEELING THAT
SOME OF THESE NUMBERS THAT THE
SCIENTISTS ARE PUTTING OUT ARE
NOT RIGHT.
>> I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT.
I MEAN, I DIDN'T KNOW IT, BUT I
KNEW IT.
>> ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS
SWINDLERS IS COLUMBIA BIOLOGY
PROFESSOR, NOBEL PRIZE WINNER
DR. MARTIN CHALFEY.
I CAUGHT UP WITH HIM AT HIS
LUXURIOUS PALACE OF SCIENCE.
I'LL PLAY ALONG HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU STUDYING?
>> I'M STUDYING NERVE CELL
DEVELOPMENT.
>> YEAH, THE OLDEST GRIFT IN THE
BOOK, RIGHT, THE OLD SWITCHEROO.
>> PROBABLY NO OTHER OCCUPATION
HAS SO MANY PEOPLE QUESTIONING
WHAT THEY DO ALL THE TIME.
AND DEMAND THAT YOU CONFIRM THE
EXPERIMENT.
>> BUT EVEN THAT'S A NEAT LITTLE
TRAP.
>> SCIENTISTS ARE THE ONLY
PEOPLE QUALIFIED TO COMMENT ON
SCIENTIFIC THEORIES.
THIS IS WHAT RAISES DOUBT WITH
NOT ONLY REPUBLICANS BUT
AMERICANS.
>> IT'S LIKE WHY ARE SURE JOBS
THE ONLY ONES ALLOWED TO PERFORM
SURGERIES AND OTHER SURGEONS ARE
THE ONLY ONES WHO GET TO SAY
WHETHER OR NOT THIS SURGERY IS
NECESSARY OR NOT, RIGHT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
>> IT NEVER MAKES ANY SENSE.
>> AND THE ONLY OTHER PEOPLE
THAT CAN CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT
THEY'RE NOT MANIPULATING...
>> ARE OTHER SCIENTISTS.
>> THEY'RE VERY SMART, THESE
SCIENTISTS.
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
>> IT'S ALL TOO OBVIOUS ONCE YOU
KNOW THE SCAM.
>> IT'S NOT REALLY A SCAM.
ALL THAT WE DO IN SCIENCE IS
SUBJECTED TO A PROCESS CALLED
PEER REVIEW.
>> BUT WHO ARE YOUR PEERS?
>> THE PEERS ARE OTHER
SCIENTISTS.
>> BINGO.
IT'S LIKE YOU WENT ON TRIAL FOR
RAPE AND THE JURY IS FULL OF
RAPISTS.
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU DIFFERENT
FROM A RAPIST IN
>> DEFINITELY NOT A RAPIST.
>> THAT'S WHAT A WIPIST WOULD
SAY.
[LAUGHTER]
TELL ME HOW YOU ARE NOT A
RAPIST?
>> AM I REALLY SUPPOSED TO
ANSWER THIS?
>> THE WORST PART IS THE RAPISTS
ARE COMING FOR YOUR CHILDREN.
>> THOUSANDS OF ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL STUDENTS, HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENTS DO SCIENCE FAIR
PROJECTS, AND THEY DO A
SPECTACULAR JOB.
>> YOU'RE A SICK [BLEEPED].
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY
WITH THIS.
WITH OUR MOST VULNERABLE AT
STAKE, I WENT UNDERCOVER TO A
NATIONAL SCIENCE FAIR TO TRY TO
SAVE THEM FROM SCIENCE.
>> I INVESTIGATED L.E.D.
MATERIAL USING QUANTUM PHYSICS.
>> JESUS, WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO
YOU?
I NEEDED TO OPEN THEIR EYES.
>> I DID A SIMULATION OF DARK
MATTER EFFECTS ON GALAXIES.
>> YOU'RE JUST A BRIGHT-EYED KID
STEPPING OFF THE SCHOOL BUS
WANTING TO KNOW HOW THE UNIVERSE
WORKS.
>> YEAH.
>> WHO TOLD YOU THIS DATA IS
TRUE?
>> MY BRAIN GOT ME THIS
CONCLUSION AND THESE RESULTS.
>> STOP LISTENING TO YOUR BRAIN
AND START LISTENING TO YOUR
HEARTS.
YEARS FROM NOW A VIDEO POPS UP
ON THE INTERNET AND YOU'LL BREAK
YOUR PARENTS' HEART.
>> MY PARENTS SUPPORT ME.
THEY THINK SCIENCE IS GOOD.
>> PRETTY SOON YOU'RE HOOKED ON
THAT GRANT MONEY, LOOKING FOR
NEXT BIG SCORE.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
>> YES.
[LAUGHTER]
>> WHAT?
>> YEAH.
IT'S TAUGHT ME A LOT.
>> WHAT I WITNESSED WAS
HEARTBREAKING, AND SADLY WHETHER
SCIENCE IS PEDDLING QUANTUM
PHYSICS OR EVOLUTION, THE
CORRUPTION OF OUR CHILDREN
HAPPENS EVERY DAY RIGHT UNDER
OUR NOSES.
>> IT'S VERY CONFUSING FOR A
CHILD TO BE ONLY TAUGHT
EVOLUTION TO, GO HOME TO A
HOUSEHOLD WHERE THEIR PARENTS
SAY, WELL, WAIT A MINUTE, YOU
KNOW, GOD CREATED THE EARTH.
>> WHAT IS THE POINT OF TEACHING
CHILDREN FACTS IF IT'S JUST
GOING TO CONFUSE THEM.
>> IT CONFUSES THE CHILDREN WHEN
THEY GO HOME.
WE AS AMERICANS, WE'RE PAYING
TAX DOLLARS FOR OUR CHILDREN TO
BE EDUCATED.
WE NEED TO OFFER THEM EVERY
THEORY THAT'S OUT THERE.
IT'S ALL ABOUT CHOICE.
IT'S ALL ABOUT FREEDOM.
>> I MEAN, IT SHOULD BE UP TO
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO DECIDE
WHAT'S TRUE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
DOESN'T IT MAKE COMMON SENSE?
>> TRAGICALLY, THE FUTURE OFFERS
LITTLE HOPE.
DO YOU WANT TO BE A SCIENTIST?
>> YEAH.
>> THIS COUNTRY IS IN BIG
TROUBLE AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF
PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
>> SORRY.
>> SORRY IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
